<p class="transnote">Transcriber&rsquo;s notes:<br />
<br />
In this HTML version, page numbers are shown in the right margin,
hyperlinks are indicated by a black dotted underline, and a red dashed
underline indicates the presence of a transcriber's comment; scrolling
the mouse cursor over such text will reveal the comment. Footnote
markers in the text are hyperlinked to the footnotes located at the end
of the book.<br />
<br />
Pages mentioned in the list of errata (following the preface) are
hyperlinked to the respective pages in the text but the quoted line
numbers are not applicable due to variable line length when viewing
the webpage on different-sized screens.<br />
<br />
Capitalisation, hyphenation, and spelling styles vary throughout the
book and almost all have been left in the original format (occasionally
marked by [sic]); some of the more obvious variations are listed
below. Inserted corrections are enclosed within [ ]. Abbreviations such
as U.S., M.A., and M.D. vary as to whether they are spaced or closed
up.<br />

<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<p>It is difficult to account for the fact that Hydropathy
was practised at Gräfenberg, and at many other establishments
in Germany, and that books on that subject
were published in that country, twenty years before it
was known in England.</p>

<p>Most works treat upon some familiar subject, and
are supported or opposed; but my book on the Water-cure,
from its great novelty, placed me in almost as
isolated a position at the time, as the publication of
Bruce&rsquo;s Travels did their author.</p>

<p>A gentleman who had been at an establishment in
Germany, and who afterwards wrote in favour of the
cure, on seeing the review of my work in the Times,
addressed me a letter wishing me every success, and
saying &ldquo;that I had put my hand into a hornet&rsquo;s nest:
that I had that day made a hundred thousand enemies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>These fears, I am happy to say, have not been
realised: at least, as far as I know. The leading
papers reviewed my work favourably; my lectures
in England, Ireland, and Scotland, met with serious
attention; and baths and wash-houses resulted from a
lecture I gave in Edinburgh.</p>

<p>I have found numbers of persons willing to give
the system a trial; but unfortunately, few could spare
time to go to Gräfenberg, where it is carried out with
safety and success by the immortal Priessnitz.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="iv"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv"></a></span></p>
<p>Though not a medical man, I seldom refused to
administer aid when it was asked of me, and I have
the satisfaction of knowing that no accident ever
attended my operation; on the contrary, my humble
endeavours, in every instance, were more or less
crowned with success. I am bound, in candour, to
say, that from members of the medical profession with
whom I have had the honour of becoming acquainted,
I have invariably met with the greatest courtesy.</p>

<p>The propagation of any novelty, however useful, is
a work of time,&mdash;especially when, like Hydropathy,
it attacks the deep-rooted prejudices of society, and is
opposed to the interests of a host of individuals.</p>

<p>Hydropathy&mdash;unlike brandy and salt, mustard-seed,
and many other chimeras with which its opponents
wished to rank it&mdash;is not to be put down. During
the short period of eight years, its principles have
pervaded all society: we can hardly go into any
society that we do not find its advocate. The upper
classes drink more water and less wine; the poorer
classes are beginning to bathe: for this purpose, baths
and wash-houses are open or being erected in most of
the metropolitan parishes&mdash;or, as it is expected they
will pay their own expenses, it is to be hoped they
will be provided for the poor in every parish in
England.</p>

<p>Hydropathic establishments are now to be found in
England, Ireland, and Scotland, and in America; and
the practice of the Water-cure has penetrated to the
Antipodes. Hardly a week elapses but some work
appears on the subject. Messrs. Abdy&rsquo;s &ldquo;Diseases
Cured by Cold Water;&rdquo; Sir Eardley Wilmot&rsquo;s &ldquo;Tribute
to the Water-cure;&rdquo; Col. Dundas&rsquo; work, &ldquo;To the Halt,
Lame, and Lazy;&rdquo; Mr. Lane&rsquo;s &ldquo;Life at the Watercure;&rdquo;
Sir Edward Bulwer Lytton&rsquo;s <span class="pagenum" title="v"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v"></a></span>&ldquo;Confessions of
a Water-drinker,&rdquo; are amongst those of the non-medical
productions.</p>

<p>The following is a list of medical men who have
recorded their opinions in favour of Hydropathy:&mdash;Drs.
Wilson, Gully, Johnson, Weiss, Marsden, Ellis,
Baxter, Rischanek, Weeding, Feldmann, Lovell,
Courtney, Heathcote, Balbirnie, Stummes, Paterson,
King, Curteis, Hills, Preshaw, Gibbs, Macleod,
Paisley, Smethurst, Barker, Laurie, Bushnell, Mayo,
Weatherhead, Graham, Alexander, Freeman, Martin.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding Hydropathy has made its way in
an extraordinary manner,&mdash;with the mass of evidence
that has been produced in its favour, it is matter of
surprise that it has not become <i>even more</i> general;
for it is a remarkable fact, that, in this age for writing,
whilst so many works, both in Germany, France, and
England, have appeared in support of Hydropathy, I
do not know one that has seriously attempted its
refutation. It is true that, at its first introduction,
some said my only object was to make money; others
cavilled at the term Hydropathy, the absence of diphthong
in the word Gräfenberg, its want of novelty,
the non-professional terms I made use of in my work,
and similar trifles; but no one ever wrote a line to
disprove the truth of the system, or demonstrate the
uselessness or danger of the wet sheet, sitz-bath, or,
indeed, any part of the treatment.</p>

<p>That it was my intention to make money by hydropathy
is an allegation without a foundation; my object
being completely philanthropic. Having gained
my own health and saved the life of my daughter at
Gräfenberg, and having witnessed most astounding
cures there, I wished to make generally known so
valuable a remedy,&mdash;to do this by writing, lecturing,
attending the sick, opening establishments, or any<span class="pagenum" title="vi"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi"></a></span>
other means in my power, my exertions have been
unceasing. I may therefore be permitted to repeat,
my motives have been disinterested, as, thanks to
Providence, I am perfectly independent in circumstances.
The promotion of hydropathy has always
been attended with expense to me&mdash;a sacrifice which
I am still willing to make for its advancement.</p>

<p>We claim nothing for hydropathy on the score of
novelty, because it is well known that in India the
natives understand the use of cold water in curing
fevers, wounds, bruises, etc.; in all probability it has
been their panacea for all diseases since the time of
Noah.</p>

<p>A hundred years ago, Dr. Sir John Floyer, in a
work he published, stated that he frequently saw people
with cutaneous eruptions go to a spring in his neighbourhood,
dip their shirts in it, wring them out, put
them on, and walk away. He inquired, and never
found any harm to result from thus wearing wet
linen.</p>

<p>The Russians, from time immemorial, have gone
into snow in a state of perspiration.</p>

<p>What we claim for Priessnitz&rsquo; system is, a systematic
mode of manipulating; a cautious, modified plan of
operations, by which no risk is incurred, and more good
produced than can be accomplished by any other means
known to the medical profession. Hydropathy would
doubtless have taken a much larger extension, had
the trouble attending the treatment been less, and its
practitioners more competent. It has always been
matter of regret that Mr. Priessnitz has no successor,
and that he has not himself published something on
the subject of the Water-cure. To supply this desideratum,
when last at Gräfenberg, where I stayed
twelve months, I proposed to Mr. Priessnitz that he<span class="pagenum" title="vii"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii"></a></span>
should furnish me the matter, and that I should
publish it; to this he consented, and gave me verbally
his opinion of the treatment to be followed in the
various cases as they occurred. The following pages
are my humble endeavours to place before the public
the results of our conversations as a familiar guide to
the Water-cure for men and animals.</p>

<p>The greatest enemies to hydropathy&mdash;its most
violent opponents&mdash;are those who know nothing whatever
about it; who have never seen it practised as it
ought to be, or made reasonable inquiry into the
subject. This is what every science has had to
encounter. When Lord Spencer, many years ago,
was in the habit of stating his belief that steam
and gas might be made available to useful purposes,
he was considered a madman, and would-be-wise
people declared that what he said on the subject was
absurd. Dr. Lardner, in his &ldquo;Encyclopædia,&rdquo; endeavoured
to prove, and no doubt did convince his
readers, that no steam-boat could cross the Atlantic.
Works may be read in the &ldquo;Bibliothèque&rdquo; in Paris,
written by medical men on the introduction of the
potato into France, to shew that fevers which raged
at that time in the capital arose from the use of that
vegetable.</p>

<p>Thus, it will be seen, speculative opinions are but of
little value&mdash;we want facts; and unless we are prepared
to discredit the evidence of the many respectable
professional men, and others, whose names are here
given, the value of hydropathy must be admitted.</p>

<p>The learned and talented Dr. Forbes, editor of the
&ldquo;British and Foreign Medical Review,&rdquo; says:&mdash;</p>


<p>&ldquo;The practice of the Hydropathists is so open, and
their disciples so numerous, that the innocence of
their proceedings may be said to be established by<span class="pagenum" title="viii"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii"></a></span>
the absence of evidence to the contrary. We cannot
enter any circle of society without encountering some
follower of this method, ready to narrate a series of
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: originally &lsquo;psuchrolusian&rsquo; (&lsquo;psychro-&rsquo; of or pertaining to cold)"><i>psychrolousian</i></ins>
miracles, prepared to defend and
zealous to applaud the Priessnitzian practice. Judgment
must, therefore, be entered by default against
its opponents, and Hydropathy is entitled to the
verdict of harmlessness, since cause has never been
shewn to the contrary.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>HYDROPATHY,</h2>

<p class="center">ETC. ETC.</p>

<h3>I.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Vincent Priessnitz.</span></h3>


<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Discover what will destroy life, and you are a great man&mdash;what will prolong
it and you are an impostor! Discover some invention in machinery that
will make the rich more rich, and the poor more poor, and they will build you
a statue! Discover some mystery in art, that will equalise disparities, and they
will pull down their houses to stone you.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Bulwer.</i></p></blockquote>


<p>Priessnitz was born at Gräfenberg, October, 4th 1800. His
father became blind in his nineteenth year, and remained
so until his death, which took place in 1838, a period
of thirty-two years, during fourteen of which his son was his
guide. His mother was killed by a bull in 1821.</p>

<p>Priessnitz&rsquo;s family have been in possession of the estate he
now owns, consisting of about 180 acres of land, for upwards
of 200 years, so that a mistake arose in calling him a peasant,
instead of a farmer&rsquo;s son, or yeoman of Silesia. Two centuries
ago (1645), when the country was invaded by the Swedes, a
soldier, attempting to carry off a female of the family, was
pursued and slain by one of Priessnitz&rsquo;s ancestors on the
spot now called the Priessnitz-Quelle (or spring). A tablet
placed over the spring, commemorates this event.</p>

<p>Priessnitz was born, in what is now called the &ldquo;stone house,&rdquo;
(opposite the large establishment) which he inherited with
the land.</p>

<p>He began dabbling in the Water-cure, when only twelve or
thirteen years old. Having sprained his wrist, he pumped
upon it and applied a wet bandage, which produced an <i>Ausschlag</i>,
or eruption; he not knowing whether it would be<span class="pagenum" title="2"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2"></a></span>
beneficial or otherwise. The question was, however, soon
decided; for the <i>sprain</i> was cured. Finding the same plan, in
other sprains, cuts, and bruises invariably succeed, he recommended
its adoption to his neighbours.</p>

<p>He next applied the wet bandage to swollen joints and local
pains, and was gradually led to its application in gout and
rheumatism. Observing that the wet bandage remained cold
from want of heat in the part affected, he covered it with a
dry one to prevent evaporation, and confine the heat. The
appearance of eruption in many cases before amelioration or
cure, led him to suppose that there was generally some peccant
or foreign matter required to be drawn out, or eliminated.
Thus drawn on to think and reason on the subject, his powers
of invention were kept in constant activity to find new expedients
for producing the desired effects in the fresh cases
presented to him; until the present complete and efficacious
system, or science was gradually developed and matured.</p>

<p>In treating a cut hand in one person he found it heal kindly;
in another, it became angry and inflamed: whence he concluded
that the blood of the one was healthy, and of the
other impure. Reflecting on the effect of bandages and baths,
in extracting and attracting heat, and exciting eruptions
when applied, he resorted to the elbow bath, and bandages up
the arm, to relieve the hand. Other modes of treatment were
progressively discovered and added.</p>

<p>When sixteen years of age, after loading a waggon with
hay, Priessnitz was standing at the horse&rsquo;s head, whilst his
companions were cogging the wheel; before this was effected
the horse struggled, overcame him and rushed down the hill,
which was very steep. Unwilling that the animal should destroy
itself, Priessnitz would not relinquish his hold, his foot caught
in a bush and he fell between the horse&rsquo;s feet, was dragged,
trampled upon and severely bruised. He was taken up senseless,
with two of his front teeth gone, and three ribs on the
left side broken, he was carried home, and a doctor sent for:
who, after causing great pain by probing and <i>punching</i> the side,
applied his remedies, at the same time prognosticating that
his patient would never perfectly recover. Priessnitz having
no respect for treatment or opinion, declined the doctor&rsquo;s
further attendance.</p>

<p>He then began to manage himself. By frequently holding<span class="pagenum" title="3"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3"></a></span>
his breath, and pressing his abdomen on the side of a table,
for a painful length of time, he forced back the ribs into their
proper position. Wet bandages were constantly applied and
changed, and water drunk in abundance. By perseverance in
these means he rapidly mended, and in twelvemonths his health
was completely restored.</p>

<p>His own faith and that of many of his neighbours in the
power of water was thus established; and ere long the peasantry
from all sides flocked to him for aid. Some thought
him endowed with the power of witchcraft; others honored
him as a prophet; all wondering at his success in curing disease.
Sponges used by him in washing his patients were
regarded as talismans&mdash;as containing within them something
gifted with a mysterious and marvellous operation. Broom-sticks
were placed across his doorway, to see whether on coming
out he could get over without displacing them, it being a
prevalent opinion that only those practising witchcraft can.</p>

<p>His antagonists took advantage of this disposition of the people;
and their opinion that Priessnitz was possessed by an evil spirit
was encouraged by the priests, who denounced him publicly in
the church. Some idea of the excitement got up against him
may be found, from the fact, that the peasantry were in the
habit of throwing stones at the early visitors to his house.</p>

<p>Numbers, however, came to him for advice, which he then
only gave at his own house; afterwards he was induced to
visit his patients. This seemed to dissolve the spell, and his
reputation began to decline, notwithstanding he claimed no
remuneration nor accepted any fee: from hundreds his applicants
fell off to tens. He soon perceived that what is simple,
costing neither money nor trouble, loses its value, or is but
coldly appreciated; he therefore returned to his previous usage
of giving advice only at home, leaving people to believe as
much as they pleased in the magical virtues of his remedies.</p>

<p>His reputation now rose higher than ever, and spread far
and wide. Strangers from distant parts came to Gräfenberg,
so that he was compelled to increase the size of his house for
their accommodation; and thus his establishment commenced.</p>

<p>He was not yet, however, allowed to proceed smoothly in
his career: many viewed his growing reputation with jealousy.
The two medical men and the Burgomaster at Freiwaldau set
on foot a conspiracy to crush him. Their persecutions lasted<span class="pagenum" title="4"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4"></a></span>
thirteen years: but, as frequently occurs in similar cases, these
were among the circumstances that eventually advanced his
success; since but for this pressure from without, he never
would have so completely developed the power of water over
disease; and the physiological and pathological truths that have
in consequence come to light, must still have lain buried in
darkness. During all this period, he was strictly watched, to
see if he applied aught else than the pure element; calling for
the exertion of his utmost ingenuity, to supply, by water alone,
the place of every other remedy.</p>

<p>He was frequently brought before the Syndic at Freiwaldau;
but all endeavours to convict him of any unlawful act (which
the administration of drugs or herbs in an unlicensed practitioner
would have been) had failed, when in 1828, a more determined
attempt was made to put an end to his proceedings.
Witnesses were brought forward to prove that he had injured
them, and others that he had pretended to cures that had
actually been performed by the medical men. But none, when
examined, could deny that Priessnitz had benefited them, and
taken no payment in return.</p>

<p>There was a miller, whom both the doctor and Priessnitz
claimed the merit of curing. On being examined, the miller
was asked which of the two had effected the cure? &ldquo;What
shall I say?&rdquo; answered he: &ldquo;<i>Both</i>; the doctor relieved me of
my money, and Priessnitz of my disease. In return, I have
given him nothing&mdash;not even thanks, which I take this opportunity
of offering him for the first time.&rdquo; This was of little
avail; his calumniators had resolved his downfall. Accordingly,
he was next accused of quackery, in illegally tampering with
the public health, and ordered to be put under arrest. An appeal
to the tribunal at Brünn, caused this unjust sentence to be
reversed; and he then obtained permission to have a cold-water
bathing establishment. Discontented at this, his persecutors
shortly after brought him to the court at Weidenau, a neighbouring
town, on the hypocritical plea that the connection
between his accusers and the authorities of Freiwaldau might,
contrary to their wishes, give a colour of unfairness to the proceedings.
The tribunal of Weidenau could not reverse the
sentence of that at Brünn, but prohibited Priessnitz from treating
any persons but those of his own parish or district. He
replied that water was free to all, and that he was not in the<span class="pagenum" title="5"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5"></a></span>
habit of inquiring whence an invalid came previously to administering
aid. Feeling he was right, he persisted in acting
as before; and for some time, no further notice was taken of
him.</p>

<p>In 1831, his enemies took a bolder course, by raising an
alarm of the craft being in danger. This enlisted in their cause
the medical men at Vienna, who brought the subject under the
notice of the emperor. He sent Dr. Baron Turckheim with a
commission of district and staff surgeons to Gräfenberg, to investigate
and report on the new system, and the proceedings of
its originator. Notwithstanding that most of these gentlemen
were prejudiced against both, they were astonished and pleased
at what they witnessed; and their report was of so favourable
a nature, that Priessnitz was allowed by imperial authority to
carry on his establishment, with the addition of the privilege
enjoyed by staff surgeons of giving sick certificates to public employés
and officers under his care. This state of things was,
however, again shortly afterwards disturbed. In 1835, the emperor
Francis being dead, fresh intrigues induced the government
authorities at Troppau (a town about fifty miles from
Gräfenberg) to withdraw the permission Priessnitz had received
for giving sick certificates. He was urged to appeal to the
higher powers, but declined, saying&mdash;&ldquo;The matter must right
itself,&rdquo; and steadily refused giving sick certificates, even to
foreign officers. These complained, through their ambassadors,
to the authorities at Vienna; and for them, Priessnitz&rsquo;s power
of granting certificates was restored. The Austrian officers and
employés being still excluded, also exerted themselves through
friends in the capital; and the matter was, in the end,
satisfactorily arranged.</p>

<p>In 1843, the Prussian government, doubtless under medical
influence, forbade all officers or employés proceeding to any
hydropathic establishment out of Prussia, unless expressly
recommended by their medical advisers.</p>

<p>The greatest difficulty in obtaining passports to the Hygiean
temple is also encountered by the Russian Poles. It has been
observed by many from both these countries who, nevertheless,
reached Gräfenberg, that their medical men strongly recommended
their not going to Priessnitz, and willingly gave certificates
for any other establishment, even though in a foreign
country.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="6"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6"></a></span></p>

<p>For thirty years, although all publications against Priessnitz
and the Water-cure were tolerated in the Austrian dominions,
none in favour of either were permitted. But, as though willing
to do tardy justice and urged on by public opinion, in
July, 1845, the Vienna Gazette inserted a favourable article
on both subjects.</p>

<p>From the age of seven to twenty-one, Priessnitz was
in constant attendance on his blind father; and on that
account, escaped the liability of being drawn as a soldier.
Early in life he married a distant relation of his own
name, daughter of the <i>Schulz</i> or chief magistrate of Bömishdorf,
who was by trade a miller. He has had nine children,
of whom six daughters and one son are living. The first-born,
a sickly boy, died of apoplexy. When taken ill, the wife and
relations insisted on having a physician from Nicholasdorf:
this was at the commencement of Priessnitz&rsquo;s career, and he
reluctantly yielded. He has since said he would not have given
way, had he imagined the doctor could have killed the child
so soon, for a powerful medicine being administered, death
was the almost immediate result. Priessnitz supposes it was
calomel. Whatever it was, it produced spasms and death.</p>

<p>This was a severe lesson to Mrs. Priessnitz, who since that event
has left the treatment of her children entirely to her husband.</p>

<p>As has been said, the various manipulations which now form
so complete a system, were gradually introduced just as Priessnitz
became aware of their necessity and had experience of
their effect.</p>

<p>Finding that pain was relieved by natural perspiration, he
instituted the sweating process by covering the patients up
well in bed. Some time later he improved on this, by introducing
the blankets. On a patient becoming faint, whilst
under the process, he found that opening the windows to admit
fresh air, and washing the face, afforded relief, and ordered
it with equal advantage generally. At first he sponged the
throat, then the chest, and gradually the whole body; finding
the extension of this practice most beneficial in <i>every</i> case, he
ventured on the tepid (<i>i. e.</i> 62° Fahr.) bath and ultimately the
plunge or cold bath.</p>

<p>The relief afforded by local bandages to the finger, arm, leg,
and other parts of the body afflicted with pain, or to which he
wished to attract the vicious juices, suggested the use of the<span class="pagenum" title="7"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7"></a></span>
waist bandage, which he found fulfilled many useful purposes,
especially in relieving pain in the abdomen, feverishness, and
restlessness, and also in bringing the abdominal functions into
a healthy state.</p>

<p>Satisfied of the benefit derived from local cold bandages, he
thought they might be extended over the whole of the surface
of the body; and this originated the wet sheet, which supersedes
the lancet by relieving the overcharged system of heat, and is
the most powerful sedative known. It has gradually superseded
the sweating process, though not in all cases. Priessnitz recommended
the weaker patients to remain in the blanket only
a sufficient time to get thoroughly warm; but they, thinking
to accelerate a cure, sometimes remained in it too long, and
fainted from exhaustion&mdash;a reason assigned for confining his
treatment more especially to the wet sheet.</p>

<p>In chronic cases, which resisted the application of bandages,
tepid and cold baths, he long tried local baths, to cause internal
excitement and reaction; thence arose the hip, arm, foot, and
head baths, which were generally successful: but in some obstinate
cases, where they were not so, Priessnitz wished for a
more powerful agent, and hit upon the douche, to which his
attention was drawn by reflecting on the benefit he had received
by pumping on his sprained wrist.</p>

<p>The rubbing sheet is a much later addition, being an improvement
on rubbing with wet hands, or using sponges. It is a
means of rousing latent heat, and administering an ablution to
delicate persons, who could not endure an immersion in the
bath.</p>

<p>This combination of novel and invaluable appliances will
effect any purpose attempted by the pharmacop&oelig;ia. In fact, so
complete and efficacious is the system, that it may justly be
termed a science putting into the shade all hygeian discoveries
from the days of Hippocrates to the present time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Notwithstanding there are several defects in point of beauty,
and a sternness of outline in almost every feature,&rdquo; there is
something in the whole expression of Priessnitz&rsquo;s countenance
peculiarly pleasing as well as striking; and one reads there
kindness of heart as well as firmness and decision.</p>

<p>Among all his neighbours, his character stands deservedly
high. From his infancy, he has been a pattern of sobriety and
virtue, a good Christian, kind neighbour, an excellent husband<span class="pagenum" title="8"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8"></a></span>
and father; ever prompt to acts of benevolence and, though
secretly, to acts of charity. Poverty deprives no invalid of his
succour. Many, for months together, enjoy the hospitality of
his table, and benefit by his advice, who have no means of
making any pecuniary return. Indeed, Priessnitz never demands
a fee, nor complains if none be given. Nevertheless, he
has become rich by the exercise of prudence and economy.</p>

<p>It is worthy of record, that he never wrote a line or caused
anything to be inserted in newspapers on the subject of his
discoveries, or employed any of the means of publicity usually
resorted to make known his establishment; yet this is frequented
by denizens of all nations, and his fame extends to
the antipodes.</p>

<p>When the author went to Gräfenberg in 1841, there
seemed a deficiency of English; of whom he found but three.
There were members of every grade of society from the
crowned head to the beggar, all submitting themselves to
Priessnitz&rsquo;s directions.</p>

<p>Anxious to make my countrymen acquainted with a system
which had benefited thousands, and from which I had personally
derived great advantage, immediately on my return home I published
a work suggested by my visit to Gräfenberg, which proved
to be actually the first that had appeared in England on the
subject. Many English were thus induced to undertake a
journey to see Priessnitz, and several books shortly afterwards
came out, attesting the writer&rsquo;s high opinion of his skill,
with their faith in the efficacy of his method. The number
of English pilgrims to the Hygeian temple increased; and it
is at present one of their favorite resorts. In 1848, a letter
numerously signed was sent to America, and was inserted
in the <i>New York Tribune</i>.</p>

</p>

<p>&ldquo;The undersigned, desirous to alleviate suffering, and to
promote the health and comfort of human beings, wish to call
attention to the Water-cure as practised by Vincent Priessnitz.
Not a particle of medicine is ever administered in any form
or quantity. No bleeding, blistering, or leeching is ever
employed.</p>


<p>&ldquo;It is not pretended that the Water-cure is a universal<span class="pagenum" title="9"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9"></a></span>
specific for all diseases; but there are sufficient facts to prove
that all diseases curable, and many incurable by any known
means, can be healed by a proper application of the Water-cure,
which the following cases will demonstrate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Count Mitrowski, an Austrian nobleman, aged fifty-four,
who had long been afflicted with gout, and whose name we
are permitted to use, was found insensible in his bed in an
apoplectic fit. Some medical men were quickly in attendance
and Priessnitz was sent for. The professional men considered
the Count past recovery; and one of them said that he would
throw his drugs away and become an hydropathist if this
patient was restored. It was proposed by some to bleed the
invalid, to which Priessnitz objected, if he was to bear any
part of the responsibility. So far gone was the patient, and
so nearly extinct did vitality appear, that a priest administered
the extreme unction, and according to the custom of the
country, a lighted candle was placed in each hand of the
apparently dead man. By cold water treatment alone under
the sagacious direction of Priessnitz, this gentleman recovered
consciousness on the <i>third day</i>, drove out in a phaeton on the
fourth, and gradually returned to his former habits.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The only son of a Sovereign Prince, aged three years,
suffered for fifteen months from chronic obstruction of the
bowels, which baffled the skill of his medical attendants, and
resulted in total atrophy. For twenty-seven days the child had
<i>had no relief</i>, when, by the physician&rsquo;s advice, Priessnitz was
called in. He saw the child; and at his suggestion the
Prince and his family came here, in order that Priessnitz
might daily superintend the treatment. In a few days the
disease yielded to the water-cure, and at the end of three
months, the child returned quite well.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A lady of rank suffered severely from frequent head-aches,
cramp in the stomach, indigestion, and other maladies, which
cannot here be particularised. She constantly threw up her
food, even whilst in the act of eating, and could not have
the slightest relief without medicine, and even then had great
pain and difficulty. She had been under medical treatment
for fourteen years, during which time she consulted fourteen
eminent physicians. In little more than a year under the
Water-cure, she was restored to perfect health.</p>


<p>&ldquo;A gentleman had one of the worst attacks of small-pox,<span class="pagenum" title="10"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"></a></span>
complicated with measles. From the fact of his vomiting
blood any medical man will judge of the malignity of the
disease.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In a fortnight he was out of doors; and in four weeks all
traces of the disease were rapidly disappearing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here is one case of a gentleman advanced in life and long
an invalid,&mdash;another of a tender infant,&mdash;a third of a lady,&mdash;a
fourth of a person labouring under what is generally considered
a fatal disease, and <i>all restored</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The undersigned trust you will kindly insert this statement,
which they are impelled to offer from a desire to make known
to others the benefit derivable from a system in the efficacy of
which, as well as in the sagacity and skill of its founder
Priessnitz they have the fullest confidence, and to which, humanly
speaking, some of them owe their lives, and are,</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">&ldquo;Sir,</span>

<p>In 1845 a work of a very different tendency appeared,
which, though approving of the hydropathic treatment in itself,
denounced Priessnitz&rsquo;s application of it, and calumniated him
personally in the most unwarrantable and groundless manner.
The author was R. H. Graham, M. D.; and so unpardonable
was his attack on Priessnitz that it drew forth the following
letter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="12"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"></a></span></p>

<p class="ml15pc mt15em">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">To the Editor of the London Times</span>,</p>

<p class="inrt">&ldquo;<i>Gräfenberg, 2nd February, 1845</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Sir.</span>&mdash;We, the undersigned British and Americans, who
have resided here for periods varying from three months to
two years and upwards, and who consequently have had
ample opportunities of acquiring correct information, deem it
our duty publicly to assert that a work, entitled &lsquo;A true
Report of the Water-cure, by Robert Hay Graham, M.D.&rsquo;
abounds in gross exaggerations, mis-statements, and calumnies
respecting Priessnitz. It would lengthen this document too
much to go into a detailed repetition of all those portions of
Dr. Graham&rsquo;s work which we could contradict; we therefore
refrain from noticing any in particular: it will be sufficient to
say, that <i>from personal observations</i>, we can deny several of
Dr. Graham&rsquo;s allegations, and, from information upon which
we <i>can</i> rely, we are convinced that many more are totally
devoid of foundation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have seen a letter dated January 15th, 1845, from
Captain Wollf, whom Dr. Graham gives as his authority for
some of his most unfounded assertions, and to whom he dedicates
his book; and we beg attention to the following extracts
from that letter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I not only&rsquo; says Captain Wolff, &lsquo;was a passionate Hydropathist,
but am still, to this day, known as an out-and-out one
... the information which I gave Dr. Graham, concerned
solely the scientific part of the Water-cure, and could not, of
course, be otherwise than favourable; I being, as above stated,
an Hydropathist. With regard to the wretched stuff you
allude to, as to whether Mr. and Mrs. P. drink wine or grog,
whether Miss J. S. and other English ladies were treated with
or without clothes, the tiresome story about Munde, or whether
the Princess L. did or did not employ the Water-cure, with
such like, I have never concerned myself; for I lived at Gräfenberg
exclusively for the Water-cure.&rsquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;Thus does Dr. Graham&rsquo;s principal witness fail him! It is
only necessary to add, that we do not place the least reliance
on any of Dr. Graham&rsquo;s statements. We are led to say thus
much from regard to truth, and from esteem for a great and
good man, who has been basely vilified.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="13"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"></a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;In our opinion Priessnitz, from long practice, varied experience,
and close observation, guided by his extraordinary genius,
has acquired so intimate a knowledge of the action of water,
of its dangers and advantages as regards the human body,
both in health and disease, that the most delicate invalid may
safely rely on his judgment; and in this opinion we are sustained
by the fact of his great success in the treatment of almost
every variety of disease, which surpasses that of any physicians
on record. The patients who seek his aid may be divided,
with few exceptions, into two classes:&mdash;those who by medical
men have been pronounced incurable; and those, whose diseases
are the result of medical treatment: and, out of the large
number whom he yearly treats, it would be absurd to expect
that he should never lose one. But we cannot believe that the
Water-cure is the best remedy for disease, without also believing
that he, its discoverer, is the best practitioner of it; and
to convince us to the contrary would require somewhat stronger
and more unexceptionable testimony than that of Dr. Graham.
From the portrait which Dr. Graham draws of Priessnitz, one
who did not know him, would be apt to imagine him as full
of assumption and Charlatanism, whereas he is as far from
either as any man; being as remarkable for his simplicity and
truth, as for a native modesty and unassuming propriety of demeanour,
which, combined with his kindliness of heart, win
respect and regard from almost all who approach him. Requesting
that you will do us the favour to give insertion to
this letter, We are, Sir, Your obedient Servants,</p>

<p>If Dr. Graham&rsquo;s object was to injure Priessnitz, it was, unquestionably
thoroughly defeated; for his fame continued to
increase, and at the end of the same year, Gräfenberg was<span class="pagenum" title="14"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"></a></span>
honoured by a visit from the Archduke Charles, heir apparent to
the imperial crown of Austria, who treated Priessnitz with the
greatest consideration, and shewed great interest in the Hydropathic
treatment. On his arrival, an address was presented to
him, numerously signed by the visitors at Gräfenberg, and
presented by&mdash;</p>

<p class="ml2em mt15em"><i>Address presented to</i> <span class="smcap">Archduke Franz Carl</span>, <i>at
Gräfenberg, October 4th, 1845</i>.</p>


<p>&ldquo;We, the undersigned natives of various countries, enjoying
here the hospitality and protection of a paternal government,
hasten to take advantage of the propitious occasion
offered by the presence of your Imperial and Royal Highness,
to lay our homage at your feet. How could we fail to evince
the sentiments of gratitude which we entertain towards your
illustrious house, for the favour it has deigned to grant for the
development of a system, which has produced such happy
results on ourselves, on that around us, and on the thousands
of invalids who have preceded us. The protection of Government
having been extended to the establishment at Gräfenberg
and Freiwaldau, your Royal and Imperial Highness has
judged it not unworthy to see with your own eyes the marvellous
effects of a treatment, which gradually spreading over the
universe, will preserve the human race from the double
curse of intemperance and disease. For this condescension
we tender our thanks. In all times and in all countries the
use of cold water as a curative means has been acknowledged.
The great physicians of past ages already had recourse to it.
Travellers relate singular cures effected by its means amongst
even the most savage tribes. In recent times we occasionally
see light feebly penetrating through the darkness of prejudice
and routine, and revealing the neglected virtues of this simple<span class="pagenum" title="15"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"></a></span>
gift of nature; but these facts remaining isolated, the germs
of such a noble discovery had hitherto always remained undeveloped.
It was reserved to the soil of Austria to give birth
to the immortal author of a system which can already rank
among the sciences. Priessnitz, a simple farmer, in a poor and
retired hamlet, obeying only the promptings of his genius,
has triumphed over all obstacles, and, still young, has marched
with a rapid step towards the destiny of great men. Relying
solely on observation and experience, he realised truths which
the science of ages could not reveal. The fame of his marvellous
cures resounded at first in the immediate neighbourhood:
but his star always rising and never vacillating, at last
ended by shining throughout the world. Invalids from the
most remote countries hastened in great numbers to submit
themselves implicitly to his directions. Many disciples of
medicine even hesitated not to throw aside their prejudice,
and become enlightened by his discoveries. His cottage
became the refuge of suffering humanity, his hamlet the seat
of a new doctrine; still, far from being intoxicated with so
much success and such unexpected good fortune, Priessnitz
has in no way deviated from his original simplicity and primitive
manners. His greatest ambition is the accomplishment
of the laborious task he has imposed on himself; his sweetest
recompence the affection and veneration of all who surround
him. We know not which to admire most, the rare genius
of this gifted man, or the firmness and modesty which
characterise him. Guided by gratitude, and the admiration
we feel for the Hydropathic system and its origination, we
have ventured to present this humble address to your Imperial
and Royal Highness, trusting that the visit of such an enlightened
Prince will be a good augury for the further
dev[e]lopment and extension of the curative system from which
we have ourselves experienced such happy results.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="mt15em">In the ensuing summer a most flattering testimony was
decreed to Priessnitz by the Emperor of Austria. It was a
gold medal (called a <i>Verdienst Medaille</i> or medal of merit),
and was presented to him by the Governor of Troppau, on the
7th of July, 1846, at the altar, with great ceremony, in the
very church in which he had been formerly denounced.
Shortly after, an incident occurred which had nearly deprived<span class="pagenum" title="16"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"></a></span>
the world of this great man: this was the marriage of his
eldest daughter, then only seventeen, to an Hungarian nobleman
of large fortune. The young couple started for Hungary;
and Priessnitz, on taking leave of them, was observed to be
much affected. Later in the day, whilst visiting his patients,
he found it difficult to lift one hand to his head. He hurried
home, where he hardly arrived when he was suddenly struck with
general paralysis, and was quite insensible. His attendants resorted
to his own remedies, he was placed in a tepid bath and
rubbed by four persons for nearly two hours before he began to
regain his senses, when he ordered the tepid water to be changed
for cold; and he has since been heard to say, the former would
not have been attended with sufficient reaction, and consequently
would not have had the desired effect. He now
ordered his own treatment and recovered in a few days; his
health was afterwards re-established by a fortnight&rsquo;s visit to
his daughter in Hungary.</p>

<p>A few months since he was rejoiced by the birth of a son.
This event conferred great happiness on him; for, as may be
remembered, his first-born whom he lost was a son, and all his
other children until the last, were daughters.</p>

<p>It is to be hoped, that Providence will spare his valuable
life to see his son grow up, so that he may initiate him
experimentally in the theory of Hydropathy, which can never
be perfectly disseminated in any other way.</p>

<p>Several monuments and fountains erected at Gräfenberg,
testify the admiration and respect in which Priessnitz is held.
The English and the Hamburghers are at present engaged in
erecting similar testimonies. The latter have placed his bust
in the Exchange at Hamburg.</p>

<p>Judging from the strides Hydropathy is making, it is fair
to conclude that in the course of time these examples will be
followed by every nation in the world.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">1</a></p>

<h3>II.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Hydropathy.</span></h3>

<p>The term &ldquo;hydropathy,&rdquo; has been cavilled at; its etymological
sense meaning &ldquo;water-disease,&rdquo; whilst its conventional sense
means &ldquo;water-cure.&rdquo; If disposed to dispute about terms, we
might say that &ldquo;physiology,&rdquo; in its etymological sense, means
merely a discourse about nature; whilst, in a conventional
sense, we understand it to treat of the science of animal life.
For want of a better word, that of &ldquo;hydropathy&rdquo; was adopted,
to express the manner of curing disease, by cold and tepid
general and local baths, wet sheets (sometimes called linen
baths), dripping-sheets, douche and friction, air, exercise,
and drinking water. To this may be added, simplicity in our
habits, and temperance in our manner of living.</p>

<p>In fact, by the term &ldquo;hydropathy,&rdquo; were intended all those
appliances by which nature may be put in the best possible way
of assisting herself, since no allopathist, <ins title="Transcriber's Note: should be &lsquo;hom&oelig;opathist&rsquo;or &lsquo;homeopathist&rsquo;">homæopathist</ins>, or hydropathist,
will pretend that anything he can administer has
of itself any healing virtue. It is a common observation, that
riding, climbing, and exercise, give us strength; the horses,
hedges, mountains and ground, do not, however, impart strength,
but they afford the opportunity, the necessary resistance
to develop or increase that strength which is in us. The
weak man, do what you will, can only develop the strength
which is in him, and the strong man the same. Let, therefore,
the reader judge which is best calculated to cause that development&mdash;hydropathy
or drugs.</p>


<h3>III.&mdash;<span class="smcap">What Does Hydropathic Treatment Effect?</span></h3>

<p>It promotes the vital energies, quickens the action of the
absorbents, strengthens the nerves, allays irritation, promotes
healthy action of the vital organs.</p>

<p>The extreme vessels deposit healthy particles, which the
absorbents remove.</p>

<p>Dr. Gibbs, in his &ldquo;Letters from Gräfenberg,&rdquo; states that
water, applied hydropathically, acts in the following ways:&mdash;</p>

<div class="hangin">
<p>1st. By the more rapid liberation of caloric.</p>

<p>2nd. By accelerating the change of tissues.</p>

<p>3rd. By constringing the capillaries.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="18"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"></a></span></p>
<p>4th. By increasing nervous power.</p>

<p>5th. By restoring tone to the skin.</p>

<p>6th. By derivation.</p>

<p>7th. By forwarding the elimination of morbific matter; or, in
other words, as a sedative, alterative, tonic, stimulant,
derivative, and counter-irritant.</p></div>

<p>And taken internally, it acts&mdash;</p>

<div class="hangin">
<p>1st. As a solvent, and contributes to the greater part of the
transformations.</p>

<p>2nd. Gives tone to the stomach.</p>

<p>3rd. Promotes the secretions and excretions, particularly from
the skin, bowels, and kidneys.</p>

<p>4th. It is a most important and indispensable element in the
blood; and &ldquo;its partial application,&rdquo; says Dr. Johnson,
&ldquo;acts by determining the force of oxygen from one
part to another; it produces all the effects of bleeding
and blistering&mdash;except the pain,&rdquo; and he might have
added, the debility.</p></div>

<p>The hydropathic treatment causes the elimination of all
foreign matters from the body, and thereby promotes contraction,
without which there can be no health, which Dr. Billing
has shewn to demonstration; he states &ldquo;that the proximate
cause of <i>all</i> disease is relaxation and enlargement of the capillaries:
the indication of a cure, therefore, is to constringe the
capillaries, and cause them to contract, and resume their healthy
state.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As all organic action is contraction, all organic or animal
strength depends upon the power of the different parts of the
body to contract.&rdquo; If it be true, that the effect to be brought
about in the treatment of <i>all</i> disease is to unload and constringe
the capillaries, how can this be better achieved than by the
sweating or wet-sheet process, and the cold bath; Dr. Johnson
says&mdash;&ldquo;The hydropathic treatment, which unloads the capillaries
by sweating, and constringes them by cold, is clearly an
efficient substitute for bleeding, purging, vomiting, uva ursi,
digitalis, antimony, mercury, arsenic, nitrate of silver, sulphate
of copper, iodine, iron, and multitudes of other remedies,
enumerated by Dr. Billing, merely by their power of unloading
and constringing the capillaries.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Priessnitz&rsquo;s theory:&mdash;</p>

<div class="hangin">

<p>1st. That by the hydropathic treatment, the bad juices are
brought to, and discharged by, the skin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="19"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"></a></span></p>

<p>2nd. A new circulation is given to the diseased or inactive
organs, and better juices infused into them.</p>

<p>3rd. All the functions of the body are brought into a normal
state, not by operating upon any particular function,
but upon the whole.</p></div>

<p>If these are the results of hydropathy&mdash;and that they are so,
has never been disputed; nay, the truth is even proved by the
following great medical authority unconnected with the water
cure: it must be admitted that the sooner drugs are dispensed
with the better.</p>

<p class="ml2em mt15em"><i>British and Foreign Medical Review, and Quarterly Journal,
October, 1846.&mdash;Extract.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;The water cure is a <i>stomachic</i>, since it invariably increases
the appetite.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a <i>local calefacient</i> in the wet sheet covered by a dry
one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a <i>derivative</i>; cold friction at one part, by <i>exciting increased
action there, producing corresponding diminution elsewhere</i>;
<i>the compress</i> frequently acting, if not like a blister, at least
<i>like a mustard poultice</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>It is a local as well as a general counter-irritant.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>It is essentially alterative</i> in the continual removal of old
matter: its renewal is shewn in the maintenance of the same
weight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;An important hydropathic principle is, that almost all its
<i>measures are applied to the surface</i>. One of the most formidable
difficulties with which the ordinary physician has to contend
is, that nearly all his remedies reach the point to which they
are directed <i>through one channel</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The only means of relieving certain diseases is <i>by inundating
the stomach</i> and bowels with foreign and <i>frequently</i>
to them <i>pernicious substances</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hydropathy employs a system of most extensive energetic
general and local counter irritation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A fifth physiological feature of hydropathy is the number
of coolings. The <i>generation of caloric has been traced to its
right source</i>. It results from the burning up of waste matter,
which by accumulation would become injurious.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is singular enough that almost all arguments used<span class="pagenum" title="20"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"></a></span>
against cold bathing are the strongest theoretical arguments
in its favor. Dr. Baynard, a most sarcastic writer, gives us
the following anecdote:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here a demi-brained doctor of more note than <i>nous</i>,
asked, in the amazed agony of his half-understanding, how
&rsquo;twas possible that an external application should affect the
bowels, and cure pain within? &lsquo;Why doctor,&rsquo; quoth an old
woman standing by, &lsquo;by the same reason that, being wet-shod
or catching cold from without, should give you the gripes and
pain within.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If a rude exposure of the surface to cold and wet is
capable of producing internal disease, there is no <i>doubt that a
close relation exists between these agents and the morbid</i> conditions
of internal parts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After devoting upwards of thirty pages to prove the value
of Hydropathy, the reviewer sums up as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;After what has been said and written in favor of Hydropathy.&mdash;<i>Judgment
must therefore be entered by default against
its opponents, and hydropathy is entitled to the verdict of harmlessness,
since cause has never been shown to the contrary.</i>&rdquo;</p>


<h3>IV.&mdash;<span class="smcap">How are the Effects described in the last
Chapter produced?</span></h3>

<p>Are the effects, as described by hydropathists and by the
British and Foreign Medical Review, produced without purging,
vomiting, drugging, or the lancet&mdash;or by what other
means are such essential results to be attained? We answer, by
hydropathy alone are they to be produced, through the
medium of the external and internal skin or mucous membrane,
the most important organ in the human structure, and
the most neglected by the guardians of the public health;
and by the promotion of all the secretions and excretions.</p>

<p>The Abbé Sanctorius, a Florentine, might be said to have
spent twenty years of his life in a balance determining the
amount of matters thrown off by the pores of the skin. To
ascertain this, he first cleaned and then placed small glasses,
some not longer than thimbles, on various parts of the
human frame, when the result proved that every man ought
to pass off from his person, daily, from six to seven pounds.
Two and a half pounds are supposed to be released by the<span class="pagenum" title="21"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21"></a></span>
ordinary modes of evacuation, and the remainder by the pores
of the skin. Now, if this exhalation is impeded, and the
necessary amount not eliminated (which must happen if the
skin has lost that energy, which exercise of the body and
cold ablutions can alone support), what becomes of the superfluous
juices thus retained in the system? The answer is
easy; they circulate through the internal organs and become
the source of fevers, inflammations, dropsy, and all sorts
of diseases. Medical men see these effects, but do not suppose
them to have resulted from suppressed perspiration.
Instead of attacking the skin, they assault the stomach and
bowels, weaken the digestive organs, and by that means
create disease; whilst water, on the contrary, is a remedy,
possessing at once dissolving and strengthening properties,
which would seem to neutralise each other, but that we
have daily evidence to the contrary.</p>

<p>Herein lies the great secret of hydropathy: by its modes of
application, morbid humours are drawn to the surface and
eliminated, the body is cooled, and the skin put into a state to
perform its indispensable duty. In internal inflammations, the
morbid heat from the internal skin or mucous membrane is
drawn off by the application of cold and irritation to the surface,
and the disease subdued without charging the stomach
with anything but pure spring water, which in contradistinction
to drugs, produces the most salubrious effects.</p>

<p>The following extract shows that the skin is the great
drain through which matters injurious to the system, and
superfluous heat are drawn off and accounts for hydropathy
being so universal a remedy.</p>

<p class="ml2em mt15em"><i>A Practical Treatise on Healthy Skin, by</i> <span class="smcap">Erasmus Wilson</span>,
<i>1 Vol. 1845</i>.&mdash;<i>Extract.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;The structure of the skin and the diseases to which it is
liable, have latterly received from many of the medical profession
considerable attention. The skin is that soft and
pliant membrane which invests the whole of the external
surface of the body, as also the interior which is called
mucous membrane.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The construction of these two membranes may easily<span class="pagenum" title="22"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22"></a></span>
inform us, without having recourse to fanciful hypotheses,
how disease, affecting any part of this membrane, either
internally or externally, may pass to any other part and affect
the whole; and thus how a faulty digestion in a lady, a disease
of the investing or mucous membrane of the stomach, may
show itself in eruptions on the face. We see at once, too,
how it happens that, calling into more active action the
shower bath and flesh brush, dyspepsia may be avoided or
cured. It serves also to explain the circumstance noticed by
Fourcroy and Vauquelin, that the skin, with all its products,
&lsquo;is capable of supplying the office of the kidneys,&rsquo; and carrying
off, as we know it to imbibe nourishment, the indispensable
excretions for which the proper organs may be deficient.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In explanation of this circumstance, we must remark, that
the skin, internal or external, in which terminate all the
arteries and commence the veins, in which too, the nerves of
sensation commence, and the nerves of volition terminate, not
only envelopes the whole body internally and externally, but
is also the secretory organ of every part, and the immediate
means of communication with the external world.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The skin is the organ of contact with the external world,
and the means of making us acquainted with every part of the
universe. The senses of touch, of hearing, of smell, of taste,
are all exercised by the skin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By the vessels terminating in the skin, or of which it is
formed, all the phenomena of nutrition, and decay of appetite,
and sensation, health and disease are produced.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whatever may be the climate or temperature in which the
body is placed, it is kept at nearly one uniform and vital heat
by the varying and adapting operations of the skin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The skin is the organ by which electricity is conducted into
and out of the body.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Its functions are, in short, proportioned to its vastness; and
as it envelopes every part, so manifold are its purposes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The structure of the skin is highly curious; it consists of
two layers; the one horny and insensible, guarding from
injury; the other highly sensitive, the universal organ of
feeling, which lies beneath; the latter feels, but the former
dulls the impression.</p>


<p>&ldquo;The following will show how, by the perspiratory organs,
excess of water is removed from the blood, and the uniform
temperature of the body preserved.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="23"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23"></a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Taken separately, the little perspiratory tube with its appended
gland, is calculated to awaken in the mind very little
idea of the importance of the system to which it belongs; but
when the vast number of similar organs composing this system
are considered, we are led to form some notion, however
imperfect, of their probable influence in the health and comfort
of the individual; the reality surpasses imagination and
almost belief.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The perspiratory pores on the palm of the hand, are found
to be 3,528 in a square inch; now each of these pores being
the aperture of a little tube of about a quarter of an inch long,
it follows that in a square inch of skin on the palm of the
hand, there exists a length of tube equal to 882 inches, or
73&frac12; feet. Such a <i>drainage</i> as 73 feet in every square inch of
skin, assuming this to be the average for the whole body, is
something wonderful; and the thought naturally intrudes
itself, What if this <i>drainage were obstructed? Could we need a
stronger argument for enforcing the necessity of attention to the skin?</i>
On the pulps of the finger, where the ridges of the sensitive
layer of the true skin are somewhat finer than the palm of the
hand and on the heel, where the ridges are coarser, the number
of pores on the square inch was 2,268, and the length of tube
567 inches, or 47 feet. To obtain an estimate of the length of
tube of the perspiratory system of the whole surface of the
body, I think,&rdquo; says Dr. Wilson, &ldquo;that 2,800 might be taken as
a fair average of the number of pores in the square inch, and
700 consequently of the number of inches in length. Now
the number of square inches of surface in a man of ordinary
height and bulk is 2,500, the number of pores therefore,
7,000,000, and the number of inches of perspiratory tube
1,750,000, that is 145,833 feet, or 48,000 yards, or nearly
28 miles.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is only a specimen of the extraordinary structure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Besides the perspiratory vessels, the skin is provided with
vessels for secreting an oily substance, which is of a different
nature at different parts of the body; with vessels to repair
abrasion and provide for its growth, and carry off its decayed
parts; with nerves and blood-vessels that are probably as
numerous and extensive as the perspiratory vessels.</p>


<p>&ldquo;It must at the same time be remembered, that the interior
skin or mucous membrane, is provided with equally numerous<span class="pagenum" title="24"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"></a></span>
and complicated vessels, to answer some analogous purposes.
The whole of them may be affected by applications to the
external skin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dr. Wilson has, in his work, introduced some equally
curious and instructive passages, as to the formation and uses
of the oil-glands, the structure and functions of the hair, the
influence of diet and clothing, and the effect of exercise
and cleanliness on the health of this extensive organ.</p>


<h3>V.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Is Hydropathy a Panacea? and what Complaints
are curable by it?</span></h3>

<p>Dr. Rauss, author of a work on hydropathy which passed
through several editions, says, &ldquo;It is almost impossible for
any one to die of an acute disease, in whom reaction can
be produced, and who from the commencement is treated
Hydropathically.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Those unacquainted with this treatment will naturally
doubt its wonderful power; and the physician, when he reflects
upon the number of patients who in acute diseases have
perished under his hands, will no doubt treat it with derision;
nevertheless,&rdquo; says the Doctor, &ldquo;as I am not advancing a doctrine
that may be controverted, <i>I here publicly make known that I am
ready, by deeds as well as words, to prove all that I have stated</i>.&rdquo;
&ldquo;<i>To state</i>,&rdquo; adds the Doctor, &ldquo;<i>$1</i>&rdquo; The cure
of all acute diseases, of whatever nature or kind, with these
exceptions, is to Priessnitz merely child&rsquo;s play; in no instance
of nervous fevers or inflammations, in any stage, was he ever
known to lose a patient; and what is worthy of remark in
acute cases, a cure is effected in a few days without the subsequent
debility which results from other treatment. Whilst
I was at Gräfenberg, all descriptions of acute attacks came
under my immediate notice, and I assert, without fear of contradiction,
that they were all cured, with but one exception,&mdash;and
that a highly valued friend of my own, a medical man,
who was attacked with inflammation of the lungs. The doctor,
who was advanced in life, retained his old prejudices, and<span class="pagenum" title="25"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25"></a></span>
consequently refused to submit to the treatment until too late.
Confident in the power of Hydropathy for the last six years,
whenever occasions offered (and they were not few during my
sojourn in Ireland), I applied the treatment with invariable success.
A case of inflammation of the mucous membrane is
worthy of notice. One M. D. declared his belief that the patient
would not live two hours; the other, that he could not exist
until the evening. On the application of the wet sheet and
tepid bath, the resuscitation of the man was as by miracle.
In a case of diarrhoea, the rubbing sheet and its bath acted to
the astonishment of the family. A young man had been under
medical treatment for diarrhoea for a month, when he could not
sleep more than a quarter of an hour at a time. He abandoned
drugs, and was cured by hydropathy in three days. Dr. Engel
of Vienna, and many other writers on the subject, are quite of
the same opinion as Dr. Rauss as regards acute disease. This
mode of treatment is efficacious in chronic diseases accompanied
by atony; in all nervous affections, spasms, pains of which
medicine will not discover the cause; in cases of obstruction of
the bowels, and all the systematic evils which arise from them,
such as indigestion, hypochondria, piles, jaundice, &amp;c; in gout,
rheumatism, scrofula, and most diseases affecting women; in
fact, it is successful in a number of complaints altogether beyond
the reach of medicine. I have had frequent occasions
for admiring the result of the treatment in cases of ague,
nervous, typhus, putrid, and scarlet fevers; but its most signal
triumphs are obtained over those serious derangements of the
system produced by the abuse of drugs, or when consumptions
are produced by iodine, arsenic, or the consequences of mercury,
tartar emetic, or other dangerous medicaments, have manifested
themselves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It may be stated without the fear of contradiction (not a
word has been written to the contrary), that in small-pox,
scarlatina, measles, croup, and all the complaints incidental to
children; in fevers, inflammations, cholera, cholic, dysentery,
diarrhoea, and, in fact, all acute diseases, hydropathy competently
administered is omnipotent; and that in chronic complaints
it effects more than can be obtained by any other
means. The question is frequently put, &ldquo;Will hydropathy
cure all complaints?&rdquo; I answer it is no catholicon, no panacea;
nor is any cure for all diseases to be found.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="26"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"></a></span></p>

<div class="poemcenter">
&ldquo;As man, perhaps, the moment of his birth,<br />
Receives the lurking principle of death,<br />
The young disease that must subdue at length,<br />
Grows with his growth and strengthens with his strength.&rdquo;<br />
</div>

<p>Thus Pope viewed it, and thus it must be viewed by all who
think on the subject. What the advocates of hydropathy assert
is, that sudden fevers, of whatever nature they may be, diarrhoea,
dysentery, cholera, English or Asiatic, in fact, all complaints
that are termed acute, when the vital energies can be roused
are sure of being cured; and that in old-standing complaints,
usually denominated chronic, the water cure will do all that
can be done by drugs, and that it is all-powerful over many
complaints which are beyond the reach of all pharmaceutical
remedies.</p>


<h3>VI.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Is Hydropathy new? Why is it not generally
adopted?</span></h3>

<p>It is frequently said, by way of detracting from the merits
of the Water-cure, that it is not new, that ages buried in the
past have been witnesses to its merits. To this it may be
replied, its advocates admit that the application of water to the
cure of disease is as old as the hills;&mdash;but let me ask, breathes
there a man who can point to the page, or call the dirty manuscript,
from cavern or chest, wherein lies hid the present
process of Hydropathy&rsquo;s main arms, the wet sheet, sweating
process, the douche, etc.? Where shall we find the sage
of ancient or modern times, buried in herbalistic lore and
practice, that ever succeeded so completely in the cure of
diseases, by thrusting nothing upon his patient&rsquo;s stomachic
organs but pure unadulterated water, as Priessnitz? We seek
not to prove its novelty, but its utility.</p>

<p>It has been shewn that water as a curative agent, has been
known from the remotest period; but its means of application
were insufficient. In the days of Pliny, it agitated the Roman
world. In the sixteenth century, great efforts were made in
our own country to introduce it into practice, and again more
lately, the subject was agitated, but it did not advance. Thus it
has been with all great discoveries&mdash;witness Steam. Le Caus,
who discovered its powers two hundred years ago, was consigned
to a mad-house. The French Academy of Science
denounced Fulton&rsquo;s discovery as a chimera and absurd, as it
did Hydropathy a few years since. Others, anxious for the<span class="pagenum" title="27"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27"></a></span>
existence of a hidden treasure, were ever in search of it, each
step conducted slowly nearer the goal; but a Watt, was
required to give full and vigorous development to its powers.
Thus, it has been with water, which, unaided by its present
manifold modes of application, was nearly as ungovernable as
the steam without the engine.</p>

<p>All nations recognised and many partially profited by the
healing properties of water; but the genius of a Priessnitz was
required to explore its capabilities and resources, and, by
reducing them to a science, confer an inestimable boon on
mankind and scatter to the winds the accumulated fallacies
of ages.</p>

<p>If all these effects which we have shown, are to be produced
by Hydropathic appliances, is it not evident there is something
to be learnt? An acquaintance with its details, its <i>modus
operandi</i>, can only be acquired by study and experience, as
Lady Morgan says, &ldquo;knowledge is a fruit which no longer
grows upon trees; on the contrary, it partakes more of the
nature of the truffle, and must be dug for by those who are
desirous of tasting it.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">2</a></p>


<p><span class="pagenum" title="28"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28"></a></span></p>

<p>A Medical Education does not necessarily assist in the
knowledge of Hydropathy; on the contrary, it acts as barrier
to the acquirement of a perfect insight into it. Hydropathy
and Allopathy in their practice are like the poles asunder.</p>

<p>The question is frequently mooted, if Hydropathy is so
harmless and yet so certain in its operations, how is it that the
medical professors, whose object is to relieve their fellow-men,
and prolong their lives, do not take it up? To this
it might be answered, &ldquo;It is a difficult thing to force any to
believe the evidence of their own senses, if their instincts or
their interests (which are one and the same) happen to point
another way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the practice of Medicine, as in every thing else, there
are vested interests, those in the receipt of large sums of
money are content with things as they are, those in more
limited practice have not the courage to enter upon anything
new, however persuaded of its utility. Others are deterred
by the fear of being considered Quacks, or losing cast[e] with
their brother practitioners, and all see, that, in the ordinary
occurrences of life the application of Hydropathy is so simple,
that were it generally practised, nine tenths of the faculty<span class="pagenum" title="29"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29"></a></span>
would have to throw up their briefs. A writer in Chamber&rsquo;s
Journal justly observes,&mdash;&ldquo;If the subject be new and startling,
and still more so, if any interest or prejudice be disturbed by
it, the clearest demonstration on earth is of no avail.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Since the education of medical men (totally at variance as
it is with all the principles of the Water-cure), gives them no
advantage whatever over a non-medical man in judging of
what is, or what is not a fit case for Hydropathy; or, in prescribing
its practice, any opinion from the faculty, opposed as
their interest, and prejudices are to it, ought to be received
for as much as it is worth, and no more. One thinks Hydropathy
available in gout&mdash;another doubts that, but believes it
to be good in fevers or inflammations&mdash;a third would not
hesitate to apply it in dysentery or diarrh&oelig;a&mdash;a fourth, for a
cold&mdash;and so on through the whole category of disease; but,
with the gravity of true sons of <ins title="Transcriber's Note: originally Esculapius">Aesculapius</ins>, to their own
patients they recommend caution, which at once deters them
from trying it. When these practitioners are asked, how they arrived
at the conclusion, that the complaints they name may be
cured by this treatment, their reasons are entirely speculative;
and when pressed as to why they do not apply it, inasmuch as
they admit it to be good, they argue the impossibility of contending
with public prejudices.</p>

<p>Might we not ask, who are the authors of this state of things?
Few people think for themselves, either in Law, Physic, or
Divinity. As long as incomes from one thousand to thirty
thousand pounds a year (and that there are the latter is proved
by the returns of the Income Tax), are made by members of
the profession, no reform with their consent can be expected.
At one period, after the amputation of a limb, bleeding was
staunched by the application of boiling pitch. Paré deprecated
this treatment, and recommended the taking up arteries,
as is now done. He was treated with derision: &ldquo;What&rdquo; said the
old practitioner, &ldquo;would you hang the life of a man upon a
thread?&rdquo; When Harvey propounded his theory, he lost caste
with his brethren, and a medical writer doubts if any practitioner
of the period, who had passed forty years, believed in
the circulation of the blood.</p>

<p>Jenner, to secure himself from the fury of a mob, sought
refuge in the house of Colonel Wilson; and there is still a
minute in the books of the Foundling Hospital, the first public<span class="pagenum" title="30"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30"></a></span>
establishment that adopted Vaccination, stating that as its
application could not be entrusted to the faculty, the Committee
recommended that the operation of vaccination should
be performed by the Clergy.</p>

<p>Lady Mary Wortley Montague was so persecuted, that she
always regretted having introduced inoculation into the
country.</p>


<h3>VII.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Lancet.</span></h3>

<p>The use of the Lancet is a subject that ought to interest every
friend to humanity in an especial manner. By this, our mortal
foe, more have fallen than by the sword. The use of one is as
unjustifiable as the other. &ldquo;Blood is the life,&rdquo; this is the language
of holy writ; he who sheds that, deprives us of a part
of our existence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The use of the Lancet,&rdquo; says Dr. Dickson, &ldquo;was the invention
of an unenlightened, possibly a sanguinary age; and its
continued use says but little for the after-discoveries of ages,
or for the boasted progress of medical science.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will the men who thus lovingly pour out the blood, dispute
its importance in the animal economy? Will they deny
that it forms the basis of the solids,&mdash;that when the body has
been wasted by long diseases, it is by the blood only it can
recover its healthy volume and appearance?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Misguided by theory, man, presumptuous man, has dared
to divide what God, as a part of creation, has united; to open
what the Eternal, in the wisdom of his omniscience made
entire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is on the face of it a most unnatural proceeding. How
can you withdraw blood from one organ without depriving
every other of the material of its healthy state?</p>

<p>&ldquo;The first resource of the surgeon is the lancet. The first
thing he thinks of, when called to an accident, is how he can
most quickly open the flood-gates of the heart, to pour out the
stream of an already enfeebled existence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Capt. Owen, in detailing the mortality which took place
among his people on the coast of Africa, by yellow fever,
says, &ldquo;he had not one instance of perfect recovery after a
liberal application of the lancet. And in the subsequent report
of the Select Committee on the Western Coast of Africa, there<span class="pagenum" title="31"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31"></a></span>
occurs the following passage. &ldquo;The bleeding system has
fortunately gone out of fashion; and the frightful mortality that
attended its practice, is now no longer known on board our
ships.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let the reader,&rdquo; says Dr. Gibbs, in his letters from Gräfenberg,
&ldquo;enter the crowded hospitals in England or the Continent,
and see how mercilessly the lancet, the leech, and cupping-glass
are employed in the diseases of the poor. Look at the pale and
ghastly faces of the inmates.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Among the numerous diseases which bleeding can produce,
Darwin says, a paroxysm of gout is liable to recur. John
Hunter mentions lock-jaw and dropsy; Travers, blindness and
palsy; Marshall Hall, mania; Blundell, dysentery; Broussais,
fever and convulsion. &ldquo;When an animal loses a considerable
quantity of blood,&rdquo; says John Hunter, &ldquo;the heart increases in
frequency of strokes, as also in its violence.&rdquo; Yet these are the
indications for which professors bleed. Magendie mentions
<i>pneumonia</i> as having been produced by it; and further tells us,
that he has witnessed among its effects &ldquo;the entire train of
inflammatory phenomena;&rdquo; and mark, he adds the extraordinary
fact, &ldquo;that this inflammation will have been produced
by the very agent chiefly used to combat it.&rdquo; We read in
scripture, &ldquo;He that sheddeth man&rsquo;s blood, by man shall his
blood be shed.&rdquo; It has ever been supposed, that this applied to
the assassin; but holy writ is deeper than this! and no doubt
the time will come, when one man will no more think of
bleeding another, than he would of committing any other act
that should expose him to public ignominy.</p>

<p>The operation of blood-letting is so associated in the minds
of most men with the practice of physic, that when a sensible
German physician, some time ago, petitioned the king of Prussia
to make the employment of the lancet penal, he was
laughed at from one end of Europe to the other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The imputation of novelty,&rdquo; says Locke, &ldquo;is a terrible charge
against those who judge of men&rsquo;s heads as they do of their
perukes, by the <i>fashion</i>; and can allow none to be right, but the
received doctrine.&rdquo; Thus Hydropathy, like many other valuable
discoveries, and even Christianity itself, must wait its time; a
circumstance much to be lamented&mdash;because all that is sought
by bleeding is effected without this soul-harrowing process.
Let such as doubt the fact, go to Gräfenberg, there they will<span class="pagenum" title="32"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32"></a></span>
learn that during the whole course of Mr. Priessnitz&rsquo;s practice,
not a single drop of human blood has been spilt; and yet all
diseases for which the lancet is applied are hourly relieved.
This is a fact so notorious, that no pen has ever been raised to
deny it; so long as interest governs prejudice, practitioners
may continue their destructive practice with impunity; but
where are the feelings? As observed by a writer, &ldquo;what a long
dream of false security have mankind been dreaming! They
have laid themselves down on the laps of their medical Mentors,
they have slept a long sleep; while these, like the fabled
vampire of the poet, taking advantage of a dark night of barbarism
and ignorance, have thought it no sin to rob them of
their life&rsquo;s blood, during the profoundness of their slumber.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dr. Kitto, in his clever work on consumption says;&mdash;&ldquo;On
the subject of bleeding, purgatives, mercury, and a low course
of diet, I shall have occasion to show, in the course of my observations,
that these agents are not only unnecessary, but
actually mischievous, particularly bleeding, which has proved
more fatal than the pestilence or the sword. Nature is our
best and surest guide; and if we would follow only her admonitions,
we should not so frequently have to witness the
impotence of our efforts to alleviate suffering; or to mourn
the unfortunate results of cases, which, despite the boasted
improvements in the healing art, but too frequently terminate
in the grave.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>VIII.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Authorities in Support of Water as a
Curative Agent.</span></h3>

<p>Thales, like Homer, looked upon water as the principle of
every thing. The Spartans bathed their children as soon as
born in cold water; and the men of Sparta, both old and
young, bathed at all seasons of the year in the Eurotas, to
harden their flesh and strengthen their bodies.</p>

<p>Pindar, in one of his Olympic Odes, says, &ldquo;The best thing
is water, and the next gold.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a Greek proverb to the effect that the water of
the sea cured all ills.</p>

<p>Pythagoras recommended the use of cold baths strongly to
his disciples, to fortify both body and mind.</p>

<p>Hippocrates, the father of medicine, who added friction to<span class="pagenum" title="33"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"></a></span>
cold bathing, was accustomed to use cold water in his treatment
of the most serious illnesses. It was Hippocrates who
first observed that warm water chilled, whilst cold water
warmed.</p>

<p>The Macedonians considered warm water to be enervating;
and their women, after accouchement, were washed with cold
water.</p>

<p>Virgil called the ancient inhabitants of Italy, a race of men
hard and austere, who immersed their newly-born children in
the rivers, and accustomed them to cold water.</p>

<p>Pliny, in speaking of A. Musa, who cured Horace by means
of cold water, said that he put an end to confused drugs; and
he also alludes to a certain Charmes, who made a sensation at
Rome by the cures he effected with cold water. On being
asked what he thought drugs were sent for, he said, &ldquo;he could
not imagine, except that men might destroy themselves with
them when they were tired of living.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Celsus, called the Cicero of doctors, employed water for
complaints of the head and stomach.</p>

<p>Galen, in the second century, recommended cold bathing
to the healthy, as well as to patients labouring under the
attacks of fever.</p>

<p>Charlemagne, aware of the salubrity of cold bathing, encouraged
the use of it throughout his empire, and introduced
swimming as an amusement at his court.</p>

<p>Michael Savonarola, an Italian doctor, in 1462, recommended
cold water in gout, ophthalmia, and hæmorrhages.</p>

<p>Cardanus, of Pavia, 1575, complains that the doctors in his
time made so little use of cold water in the curing of gout.</p>

<p>Van der Heyden, a doctor at Ghent, in a work published
in 1624, states that during an epidemic dysentery, he cured
many hundreds of persons with cold water, and that during a
long practice of fifty years, the best cures he ever made were
effected with cold water.</p>

<p>Short, an English doctor, 1656, states that he had cured
the dropsy and the bite of mad dogs with cold water.</p>

<p>Dr. Sir John Floyer published a work, called &ldquo;the Psychrolusic,&rdquo;
in 1702, showing how fevers were to be cured with
water. From that period to 1722, his work went through six
editions in London.</p>

<p>Dr. Hancock, in 1722, published an anti-fever treatise upon<span class="pagenum" title="34"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34"></a></span>
the use of cold water, which went through seven editions in
one year.</p>

<p>Dr. Currie of Liverpool, who published a work in 1797, on
the use of water, introduced that element extensively in his
practice with astounding results.</p>

<p>Tissot, in his &ldquo;Advice to the People,&rdquo; published in Paris,
1770, shows the importance of cold water.</p>

<p>Hoffman, the famous German doctor, says that if there
existed anything in the world that could be called a panacea,
it was pure water: first, because that element would disagree
with nobody; secondly, because it is the best preservative
against disease; thirdly, because it would cure agues and
chronic complaints; fourthly because it responded to all
indications.</p>

<p>Hahn, who was born in Silesia, in 1714, wrote an excellent
work upon the curative agency of water in all complaints,
a copy was lately found upon a book-stall, and purchased by
Professor Oertel, for little more than one penny, and has
been re-published; it is interesting to all who regard with
attention that great moral change which the Water-cure is
calculated to effect.</p>

<p>In Dr. Hahn&rsquo;s work, it is stated that Pater Bernardo, a
Capuchin monk from Sicily, went in the year 1724 to Malta,
and there made some most astonishing water-cures, the fame
of which spread throughout Europe: he used iced water
internally and externally, and allowed his patients to eat
but very little. He made a proposition that the doctors should
take 100 patients, and said if they, by their mode of treating
them, could cure forty, then would he undertake to cure sixty
more easily and securely, and in a shorter time. His remedy of
iced water, was just as effectual in winter as in summer.
A case is cited of a man, ninety-two years of age, who was at
the point of death from the virulence of a fever, and was
cured with cold water only.</p>

<p>Evan Hahnemann, father of Homeopathy, in a work published
at Leipsic, 1784, recommends fresh water, without
which, he says, ulcers of any long standing cannot be cured,
and adds, if there be any general remedy for disease, &ldquo;it is
water.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Rev. John Wesley, <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>, published a work in 1747
(about a century ago), which went through thirty-four editions,<span class="pagenum" title="35"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35"></a></span>
called &ldquo;Primitive Physic, or an Easy and Natural Method of
Curing most Diseases.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After deprecating the manner in which drugs were imposed
upon mankind, the mysteries with which the science of medicine
is surrounded, and the interested conduct of medical men,
the Rev. gentleman proceeds to shew, that he was fully aware
of the healing powers of water; and from the long list which
he has given, and which follows, it will be evident that he
thought water capable of curing almost every disease to which
human nature is exposed. He writes:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The common method of compounding and decompounding
medicines, can never be reconciled to common sense. Experience
shews, that one thing will cure most disorders, at least as well
as twenty put together. Then why do you add the other nineteen?
Only to swell the apothecary&rsquo;s bill! nay, possibly on
purpose to prolong the distemper, that the doctor and he may
divide the spoil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How often, by thus compounding medicines of opposite
qualities, is the virtue of both utterly destroyed?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, how often do those joined together destroy life, which
singly they might have preserved?</p>

<p>&ldquo;This occasioned that caution of the great Boerhaave, against
mixing things without evident necessity, and without full proof
of the effect they will produce when joined together, as well as
of that they produce when asunder; seeing (as he observes)
that several things which taken separately are safe and powerful
medicines, when compounded not only lose their former power,
but compose a strong and deadly poison.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In recommending to his followers the use of water,
Mr. Wesley proceeds to state, &ldquo;<i>that cold bathing cures young
children of the following complaints</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p class="mt15em">&ldquo;To this children should be used from their cradles.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="37"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37"></a></span></p>
<p>We then find the following prescriptions:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>For Asthma.</i>&mdash;Take a pint of cold water every morning,
washing the head in cold water immediately after, and using
the cold bath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Rickets in Children.</i>&mdash;Dip them in cold water every morning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>To prevent apoplexy.</i>&mdash;Use the cold bath and drink only
cold water.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Ague.</i>&mdash;Go into a cold bath just before the cold.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Cancer in the breast.</i>&mdash;Use the cold bath. This has cured
many. This cured Mrs. Bates, of Leicestershire, of a cancer
in her breast, a consumption, a sciatica, and rheumatism, which
she had had nearly twenty years.</p>

<p>N.B. Generally where cold bathing is necessary to cure
disease, water-drinking is so, to prevent a relapse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Hysteric colic.</i>&mdash;Mrs. Watts, by using the cold bath two
and twenty times in a month, was entirely cured of an hysteric
colic, fits, and convulsive motions, continual sweatings and
vomitings, wandering pains in her limbs and head, and total
loss of appetite.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>To prevent the ill effects of cold.</i>&mdash;The moment a person gets
into a house, with his hands and feet quite chilled, let him put
them into a vessel of water, as cold as can be got, and hold
them there until they begin to glow, which they will do in a
minute or two. This method likewise effectually prevents
chilblains.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Consumption.</i>&mdash;Cold bathing has cured many deep consumptions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Convulsions.</i>&mdash;Use the cold bath.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And so on. In this valuable little work, from which are
the above extracts, confirmative of the value I set upon cold
water, Mr. Wesley prescribes the use of water for almost every
complaint.</p>

<p>Slade, in his &ldquo;Records of the East,&rdquo; very judiciously remarks,
with reference to the Turks, that &ldquo;notwithstanding their
ignorance of medical science, added to the extreme irregularity
of their living, both as regards diet and exercise, one day
dining off cheese and cucumbers, another day feeding on ten
greasy dishes; one month riding twelve hours daily, another
month never stirring off the sofa; smoking always, and drinking
coffee to excess; occasionally getting drunk, besides other
intemperances&mdash;combining, in short, all that our writers on<span class="pagenum" title="38"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38"></a></span>
the subject designate injurious to health&mdash;the Turks enjoy
particularly good health: and this anomaly is owing to two
causes; first, the religious necessity of washing their arms and
feet and necks, from three to five times a day, always with
cold water, generally at the fountains before the mosques, by
which practice they become protected against catarrhal affections;
second, by their constant use of the vapour bath, by
which the humours that collect in the human frame, no doctors
know how or why, occasioning a long list of disorders, are
carried off by the pores of the skin. Gout, rheumatism, head-ache,
consumption, are unknown in Turkey, thanks to the
great physicians, vapour bath and cold bath! No art has
been so much vitiated in Europe, by theories, as the art of
preserving health. Its professors, however, are beginning to
recur to first principles; and when bathing shall be properly
appreciated, three-fourths of the druggists will be obliged to
close their shops.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The question here arises: how is it that with so much
evidence in favour of water, it has never been brought into
general use? Many reasons might be assigned, but the <ins title="Transcriber's Note: originally &lsquo;principle&rsquo;">principal</ins>
one is, that until the present day no system of treatment has
ever been based on scientific principles. It was in embryo,
and, like Steam, wanted its time for development. If people
studied their health as they do their interest, they would at
least enquire into this, the best means of preserving it.</p>

<p>But in our present state of civilisation, nature is known
by name only. None save those reduced to the last stage of
poverty ever satisfy their thirst with water! Men, women,
and children, rich and poor, old and young, all avoid water&mdash;perhaps
because it costs nothing (for, in our artificial life, we
are led to esteem things according to their venal price), and,
like air and sun, is shared in common with our poorer fellow-kind.</p>

<p>The Germans are water-drinkers, but the English have a
distaste for it; few ever drank half a pint undiluted at one time,
in their lives, imagining that water will cause inconvenience,
whilst in the course of the day, they think nothing of drinking
wine, soda water, brandy and water, and tea, to a great extent,
all of which are injurious. A lady of my acquaintance
carries her distaste for water so far as to ruin the health of her
children by it. For some time the eldest, about four years old,<span class="pagenum" title="39"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39"></a></span>
had been sickly: when at Rome, the mother consulted a medical
man, who said that the child wanted nothing but water, which
was given it, and the child got well immediately. I met the
same family at Kissingen, when at a spring the nursery-maid
asked me if she might give the child water, saying the children
were always asking for it, but her mistress did not like them
to drink water alone. &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;give her as
much as she chooses to drink.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In addition to cold water, fresh air and exercise are most
important means of health. They are especially useful in giving
life and activity to the skin, which seldom meets with
proper attention, people generally not being aware of the evil
consequences attending their neglect of that most important
organ of the human frame.</p>

<p>By protecting the skin from the air, we concentrate on it
the heat that is ever exhaling from the body, and thus complete
what warm baths, spirituous liquors, want of exercise,
close rooms, and heavy nourishment, have begun. We do not
perceive that by keeping the body warm, we weaken the skin,
which becomes so sensitive to external changes, that we are
incessantly obliged to augment the thickness and number of
its coverings. At last, a time comes when nothing more can
be added to the clothing already too heavy. Then weak and
irritable persons, whose numbers&mdash;our erroneous system daily
augments!&mdash;remain at home, not aware of the innumerable
inconveniences to which such a resolution exposes them, and
not knowing that the habitual washing of the body in cold
water, would enable them to leave their heated apartments,
abandon flannel, and expose themselves, without the slightest
danger, to the healthy effects of fresh air.</p>

<p>It is the enervating softness and delicacy of modern customs,
which present the greatest obstacle to the use of cold water.
Man looks for agreeable impressions, and avoids whatever does
not produce them. But with a little courage, he would discover
that the inconvenience of a more rigorous and simple mode of
life was but momentary, and when he had found his health of
mind and body improved by it, it would soon become agreeable,
whilst from luxurious sloth ensue enervation and disgust.
Being unable to change the nature of the elements, we should
harden our bodies, familiarise ourselves with the inclemency
of the seasons, and turn them to the benefit of our health.<span class="pagenum" title="40"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40"></a></span>
It is in vain that the man whose fortune permits him to change
the climate, looks for a milder sky; if his effeminacy accompanies
him, he will be like a lady of whom Priessnitz speaks,
who near the fire was cold. A warmer air would enervate his
skin more and more; and then he would be as sensitive to
cold, even in a Neapolitan climate, as, with a hardened body,
he would be at his ease in the hut of an Esquimaux.</p>

<p>Another obstacle to the external use of cold water, is the
false belief that colds, which are the sources of much illness,
result from it. People cannot understand that a cold bath,
followed by suitable exercise, warms the feet and the body, and
that there is <i>no</i> surer preservative from cold.</p>

<p>The same incredulity is affected with regard to the revulsive
effect of the cold foot-bath; nevertheless nothing is better
proved than its efficiency in relieving the head. Every one
knows that, after having washed the face and hands in cold
water, an agreeable warmth ensues, which is not the result of
warm water. That after any part of the body has been exposed
to cold, rain, or snow, it becomes hot; and that the
reverse is the case after the use of warm water; which accounts
for people in Summer feeling cool after a warm bath.</p>

<p>When we wash the body with cold water, we should do it
quickly, lose no time in dressing, and afterwards take exercise.
Washing should be avoided when the parties are cold, because
then the re-action or re-production of heat is slower. These
precautions would prevent the most delicate persons from
taking cold, though not in the habit of using cold water.</p>

<p>Professor Oertel was the first to publish to the world the
astonishing cures which were effected at Gräfenberg; and he
was followed by Brand, Kroeber, Kurtsz, Doering, Harnish,
and a host of others, whose writings contributed to establish
the reputation of Priessnitz, who by means of the various
forms in which he administers water, attacks all diseases susceptible
of cure, and very frequently establishes the health of
those who have been declared incurable.</p>


<h3>IX.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ablutions.</span></h3>

<p>There can be no doubt, if the public were in the habit of
using cold ablutions every morning, their health would be improved,
and the number of consumptive cases much diminished.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="41"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41"></a></span></p>

<p>There are many ways of using ablutions, according to the
health and strength of the parties.</p>

<p>Strong people ought to go into a cold bath the moment
they get out of bed; then rub themselves well for three or
four minutes. If not in their usual health, the bath should
be protracted, and more friction used.</p>

<p>Another or general mode is to have a washing tub, water
only two or three inches deep, put a towel into the water,
leave the bed quite warm, step into the tub, take up the towel
with as much water as possible, and squeeze it over the head
and shoulders several times, rub the body well with the towel,
then sit down in the tub, and with wet hands rub the abdomen,
etc., for a minute or two.</p>

<p>Delicate persons may be washed all over with wet towels; sometimes
it is desirable to wash first with tepid water, then with cold.</p>

<p>Where there is a great whiteness of skin, which indicates a
want of circulation, or parties feel themselves indisposed,
dripping sheets are prescribed; the friction here used arouses
the vital energies, and in general produces a most refreshing
feeling throughout the system.</p>

<p>Priessnitz never prescribes cold immersion till the body be
prepared for it. When patients have been desirous of bathing
in a river, he has always opposed it; saying, &ldquo;Bathing excites
nervous sensibility; too much bathing excites the system to
an injurious extent.&rdquo; The various baths resorted to in hydropathy,
are to effect an object, and as such are medically applied.
Sea bathing for some constitutions is remarkably
wholesome, but to others it is injurious.</p>


<h3>X.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Use of Cold Water for Drinking and Injections.</span></h3>

<p>Dr. Arbuthnot, in his work on aliments, says that &ldquo;Water
is the chief ingredient in the animal fluids and solids; for a
dry bone distilled, affords a great quantity of insipid water:
therefore, water seems to be the proper drink for every animal.&rdquo;
Berzelius, the great Swedish chemist, proved the truth
of Dr. Arbuthnot&rsquo;s observations, by distilling the entire corpse
of a moderate sized man down to water, with the exception of
eight pounds.</p>

<p>And Milton has expressed his concurrence with those
authorities in eloquent language, when speaking of Samson:<span class="pagenum" title="42"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42"></a></span>&mdash;</p>


<div class="poemcenter">
&ldquo;O madness! to think use of strongest wines,<br />
And strongest drink, our chief support of health,<br />
When, God, with these forbidden, made choice to rear<br />
His mighty champion, strong above compare,<br />
Whose drink was only from <i>the limpid brook</i>.&rdquo;<br />
</div>


<p>About twelve ordinary size tumblers of water a day are
generally drunk whilst under the treatment; instances occur
where that number is increased to twenty, and even thirty
glasses, but such are very rare.</p>

<p>At the beginning it is difficult to drink so much water; but
by degrees we become accustomed to it. All the operations of
the cure lead to the elimination of heat, which naturally causes
thirst. Some persons on first drinking water feel sick, or have
diarrhoea, which proves that the stomach is not in a healthy
state. In this case, instead of discontinuing the drinking of
water, the quantity is increased. When pain in the stomach
comes from its being overcharged by food, water, in large
quantities is recommended to be persevered in until relief is
obtained.</p>

<p>We know that emetics produce this effect, but such remedies
weaken the stomach&mdash;while water has the contrary tendency.</p>

<p>Cold water, as a beverage, fortifies the stomach and intestines,
by clearing them of the bad juices they contain: favours
the generation of new juices, and mixes with the blood by
absorption. It spreads itself quickly through all the organs,
attenuates, purifies, and dissolves the sharp or thick humours,
and discharges them by means of perspiration and urine. Considered
as a dietetic for slight indispositions, bad digestions,
and generally in all cases of disease for which the faculty recommend
aperients or mineral waters, it cannot be too highly
appreciated. In the morning, after a cold ablution, whilst
taking exercise, drink a few tumblers of water, and conclude
every meal with a tumbler of water. It will have the same effect
as a purgative or mineral water, without, like them, weakening
the digestive organs. All persons may drink cold water at all
times of the day with impunity, if they are not inconvenienced
by it. That taken before breakfast, during exercise, produces
doubtless the best effects. It is above all after sweating that
drinking cold water produces an expectoration of phlegm. Water
may be drunk after breakfast, but not so as to overcharge the
stomach. During dinner the aliments should be moistened by
some glasses of water, then the stomach must be left to repose;<span class="pagenum" title="43"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43"></a></span>
some hours afterwards again water may be drunk until supper-time.
Drinking after supper is no less useful; but it may break
the rest, by causing an invalid to rise often in the night.
After drinking, exercise is indispensable, it stimulates the
action of the water, and accelerates a cure. When in exercise,
though in a perspiration, water may be drunk in any quantities.
Water ought always to be drawn fresh from the spring, and
drunk as cold as possible. The decanters which contain it
ought to have stoppers, to preserve it cold and fresh. After
every operation in the cure, a glass of water should be drunk;
and it should be given in small quantities when in the sweating
process. I know a gentleman who has all his life been a
free-liver, and who, notwithstanding, is in good health, which
he attributes entirely to drinking a couple of tumblers of water
the last thing at night and first thing in the morning.</p>

<p>Under the denomination of injections, we principally understand
clysters. When the patient is not in the habit of using
them with cold water, they must not at first be applied for
longer than two minutes; but by degrees the intestines become
accustomed to the water, which is often absorbed like that
introduced into the stomach. When necessary, a second injection
is repeated immediately after the expulsion of the first.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">4</a>
Cold injections are used for constipation and diarrhoea, two
diseases diametrically opposite, but which arise from the same
cause, the weakness of the intestines. Thus the contradiction
is only in appearance, the great object of injections being to
establish the tone of these organs, and regulate their functions.
Injections ought to be aided by the use of cold water in other
ways.</p>

<p>There are also other injections in use at Gräfenberg, such
as for the ears, nostrils, and genitals. Particular syringes are
used for these purposes.</p>


<h3>XI.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Cold Bath.</span></h3>

<p>The cold plunge-bath should be sufficiently deep for a man of
ordinary height to plunge into, up to his arm-pits. The water
aught[sic] to be continually renewed by a spring.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="44"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44"></a></span></p>

<p>We have quoted many authorities to shew the advantages
resulting from exposing the body to the action of cold water.</p>

<p>When cold baths disagree with us, it is because we are not
in a state to use them, or we stay in too long.</p>

<p>When the body is overcharged with drugs or alcohol, when
the juices are dried up, or when there is an apoplectic tendency,
and when in other diseased conditions, the circulation is
languid, cold plunge-baths must be used with great caution.
Many suppose that all the patients in a hydropathic establishment,
are indiscriminately ordered this sort of bath. In this
they err, because many are never allowed their use, and others
only after a long application of the rubbing sheet and tepid
baths. Strong robust constitutions may take the plunge-bath
at once; but in the Water-cure this is not allowed until the
body is prepared for it, and then only for a short time; generally
for three or four minutes. Priessnitz objects to persons
staying long in the water: of course the objection applies to
invalids. For those who bathe in the sea, or other water,
he does not pretend to prescribe.</p>

<p>Every day&rsquo;s experience proves that the immersion of the
body, covered with perspiration into cold water, is exempt
from danger, provided the internal organs are in state of
repose.</p>

<p>The risk which is incurred of catching cold on stripping and
bathing in a river, in this case cannot apply, as the body
heated by artificial means is at once immersed, whilst the
bather often, injudiciously, waits until chilled before he enters
the water.</p>

<p>If we walk fast, or a long distance, to the bath, it is requisite
to repose a little to tranquillise the lungs; then before perspiration
ceases, we ought to undress quietly, and either plunge
head foremost into the water, or wet the head and chest previously,
to prevent the blood mounting to those regions.</p>

<p>Whilst bathing, the head ought to be immersed several
times. After the sweating or packing process, great care is
to be observed in not exposing any part of the body to the air
previous to entering the bath. The patient should keep in
movement, rubbing himself well the whole time. This stimulates
the skin and abates the cold.</p>

<p>The time for remaining in the bath, is governed by the
coldness of the water, and the vital heat of the bather; a<span class="pagenum" title="45"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45"></a></span>
second sensation of cold is to be avoided, or re-action may be
difficult.</p>

<p>On leaving the bath, the patient is covered with a dry
sheet, upon which the attendant rubs, until the body presents a
warm healthy glow. The invalid should then dress quickly,
drink a glass or two of water, and walk out in the air to get
warm; to effect this by the heat of stoves or beds would be
acting in direct opposition to Hydropathic rules.</p>

<p>When irritation is excited during the cure, the cold bath is
sometimes suspended and tepid baths resorted to. Every house
ought to be supplied with a cold bath, as its habitual use
by the members of the family would secure them against
colds, influenza, etc.</p>

<p>Priessnitz says, &ldquo;that the effect of going into cold water
without being previously heated, and doing so in a state of
perspiration, is like a blacksmith hammering upon cold, rather
than hot iron. Cramp frequently attends the former, whilst a
healthy reaction is always the result of the latter.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>XII.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Is going into the Cold Bath in a State of
Perspiration attended with Danger?</span></h3>

<p>&ldquo;The transition from a Vapour-bath to snow, or to a Cold-bath,
has been practised by the Russians for time immemorial&rdquo;
with the most beneficial results,&mdash;&ldquo;this,&rdquo; adds Dr. Johnson, &ldquo;is
conclusive, that there is no danger whatever in going into the
Cold-bath while covered with perspiration; unless it can be
proved that perspiration produced by hot vapour is a very
different thing from perspiration produced by a blanket;&rdquo;
and, adds the learned doctor, in his valuable work on Hydropathy,
which every one ought to read; &ldquo;All physiological
reasoning goes to prove, that it is safer to go into cold
water when the temperature of the skin has been raised.</p>


<p>&ldquo;If there be danger at all, it is going into cold water <i>without</i>
raising the temperature of the body. It must be the temperature
that is the question; for it cannot be of consequence whether the
body be covered with grease called perspiration or hog&rsquo;s-lard.
Re-action will most certainly be produced, and congestion as
certainly prevented by going into the water when the body is
warm. Profuse perspiration does not make the body hotter,<span class="pagenum" title="46"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46"></a></span>
in proportion to its profuseness, on the contrary, it is cooler than
before, for perspiration is a cooling process.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When perspiration is present, the body is never extremely
hot. Checking perspiration is a chimerical danger; the oozing
of perspiration subsides of itself, almost at the moment the
means that produced it are withdrawn, and the perspiration
on the body is that which has been already produced, having
now no connection with the body.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At Cork in Ireland, it was told me by one of the first
brewers, that formerly his men, while in a state of perspiration,
from pressing the grain out of the vats, frequently caught cold
and died: at last they adopted the plan of going into cold
water, whilst in that state; the result of which has been that
they now never catch cold from their occupation, and are as
healthy as other people.</p>


<h3>XIII.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Packing Sheet, and Sweating Process.</span></h3>

<p>Take all the coverings off the bed, arrange the pillows, cover
over the bed and pillows with a large thick blanket, then put a
small sheet into a pail of fresh cold water; if to reduce fever,
let it be wrung out less; if there is no fever, more; the drier
the sheet, the sooner the re-action; spread this sheet so wrung
out, on the blanket.</p>

<p>The patient extends himself, divested of every thing, upon
the sheet, which should be brought over him as soon as
possible. The blanket is now brought over the sheet, and the
attendant tucks it in, beginning with the neck, as tightly
as possible, so that his patient can hardly move hand or foot.
Other blankets are then added, separately tucked in, and
turned up at the feet. Half-a-dozen blankets are not too many;
and to produce immediate heat, a feather bed is superadded,
leaving the head free. It is astonishing what an amount of
covering one may support without inconvenience.</p>

<p>The great object is so to envelop the body as to exclude the
air, and prevent evaporation, in order that its own heat may be
concentrated upon itself.</p>

<p>In ordinary cases, the sheet is well wrung out, and covered
up as before stated; but in cases of severe fever, the wet is only
covered with a single dry one. In cases of very great delicacy,
but not in fever, the sheet is put into tepid water instead of cold.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="47"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47"></a></span></p>

<p>This has by some been called a general poultice, as it performs
upon the whole body what a poultice or the bandages
effect upon members of it. Dr. Alexander of Newcastle terms
it a linen bath.</p>

<p>That wet linen should produce good and evil results appears
paradoxical. Damp beds are said to lead to injurious consequences,
whilst wet linen applied as a covering to the whole
or parts of the body, produces the most happy effects.</p>

<p>Accustomed as Priessnitz is to witnessing none but the best
results from the application of damp linen, he could not be
persuaded that mischief arose even from lying in damp beds.</p>

<p>In the Hydropathic practice the body is so hermetically enclosed
in the wet sheet, that not a particle of heat can escape
or external air penetrate, by which means the exhalation is
concentrated upon the body; this may be termed a linen bath
or fomentation.</p>

<p>In the case of people being accidentally put into a damp bed,
none of the above precautions are taken; there is no extra
clothing, no binding about the neck to prevent the escape of
caloric, and therefore to these causes must be attributed the
mischief, if any ensue.</p>

<p>It is, however, a question, where mischief follows, whether one-twentieth
part of the cases can be fairly attributed to the damp
beds. It is highly probable that Priessnitz&rsquo;s surmise of its being
the development of a disease lurking in the system which under
the Water-cure might easily be met, is correct.</p>

<p>Wet sheets are resorted to in all fevers, and changed until
the paroxysm is abated. In Typhus, the sheet is changed
every ten minutes, and as often as forty or fifty times in a day.</p>

<p>As a general rule, Mr. Priessnitz told me, if unwell, without
waiting to know the ailment&mdash;to take a packing-sheet, until
warm, twice a day, followed by a tepid bath.</p>

<p>Packing-sheets may be persevered in for years in obstinate
cases. The usual time employed in their application is until
the body is warm, which will be from twenty-five to forty
minutes. It is a great mistake to suppose the application of
the sheet is to produce perspiration. If a genial heat pervades
the body, it is all that is required, unless under peculiar circumstances,
previous to immersion in either tepid or cold
water.</p>

<p>The following anecdote, told me by Major Beavan, is ad<span class="pagenum" title="48"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48"></a></span>duced
as corroborative evidence in favour of the use of wet
linen to lower the temperature of the body. In 1821, the
Major having to pass through extensive jungles to join his
regiment in the East Indies, a distance of nearly 300 miles,
caught a fever. When at the highest stage of the hot fit, it
occurred to him that he might cool himself as they did wine
and other liquids in that climate. He accordingly had himself
wrapped up in a wet sheet for a quarter of an hour, when,
finding himself relieved, he added a number of coverings, and
fell into a most refreshing sleep of some hours. On awaking,
he found mind, body, and appetite restored, all of which had
been prostrated to an extreme degree for several days.</p>

<p>The packing-sheet is the greatest sedative known. It
generally occurs that persons who, from pain or nervous excitement,
have not slept for nights, doze off immediately on
being enveloped in the wet sheet.</p>

<p>The packing-sheet brings morbific matter to the surface, and
thereby relieves the capillaries. The ablution which follows
acts as a tonic.</p>

<p>The relief afforded to the overcharged system through the
pores, by the application of the packing-sheet, may be compared
to the emptying of a bason with a sponge; each sheet
absorbing a certain amount of morbific matter and superfluous
animal heat, until the body is relieved.</p>

<p>In fevers generally, the f&oelig;tid odour of the sheet when withdrawn,
is hardly to be endured; and in eruptive fevers, the
inclination to scratch the body is allayed, and very little inconvenient
sensation is felt either night or day.</p>

<p>In the morning, when fever is most felt, wet sheets and
tepid baths allay it; and in the afternoon, any return of it is
again subdued as before. The discovery of the wet sheet
alone is sufficient to render the name of Priessnitz immortal.</p>

<p>But when, by these means, it would be difficult to produce
perspiration, recourse is previously had to a dripping or
rubbing-sheet, and then the patient is packed up; or the blanket
is warmed before a fire, before the body is enveloped in it.</p>

<p>The sweating process, when used, is always succeeded by a
tepid or cold bath, or a dripping-sheet: if a tepid bath, cold
water is afterwards poured over the head and shoulders; but
if a dripping-sheet, it is repeated until the body is cooled.</p>

<p>Every day&rsquo;s practice at Gräfenberg, and elsewhere, shews<span class="pagenum" title="49"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49"></a></span>
that no danger attends going into cold water in a heated
state.</p>

<p>But Mr. Priessnitz, whether from having a different class of
patients, or from the difficulty of getting servants to understand
when the patient had perspired enough, or the conviction
that the same or better results attend the packing sheet, we
know not, has changed his practice, and no longer resorts
so frequently to the sweating process. The following extract is
from a letter received by the author from a gentleman who has
been a long time at Gräfenberg.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The object of all Hydropathic appliances may be shortly
and intelligibly defined, as assisting Nature to regain that
ascendancy by which she of her own accord will throw off
what is offensive to her. The practitioner ought therefore to
strengthen her in every possible way; and we have the latest
discoveries of science as a guarantee that the present (the
packing or wet-sheet process) method of carrying out the
cure effectuates this end more completely than any other;
what therefore is opposed to that, is so much drawn from the
strength which it is the object to promote, and inasmuch as
sweating, however it may tend to alleviate, undoubtedly
weakens, it is a counteracting agency.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Priessnitz is reaping the benefit of twenty years&rsquo; experience.
He follows still as he always followed (as far as it
was possible for him to read and understand) the mysteries of
his great mistress, Nature. Chance, I imagine, has in no way
guided his choice; it may have assisted him in interpreting
some of the revelations of this great spirit, but he has always
had the same unerring basis on which to establish his system.
Through imperfect light he may have sweated for a time, but
the still small voice of truth has never ceased to whisper in his
ear, and it is highly conducive to his honour that he should
now have the courage to say that in this point he erred. He
does this at the risk of reputation and fortune; he subjects
himself to the abuse of high and low; but he acts up to his
conviction, which is that the packing sheet, if to be persevered
in, is better than the sweating process.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Though, however, the sweating process is not now so general,
it is not entirely abandoned. A lady, a friend of mine, had a
cold&mdash;she was ordered to sweat lightly twice a day, for two or
three days. A gentleman had a swelling in his mouth; he was<span class="pagenum" title="50"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50"></a></span>
ordered the same. Others are ordered to sweat once or twice
a-week, but the greater part of Priessnitz&rsquo; patients never
sweat at all.</p>

<p>Priessnitz guards people against the use of hot-air and vapour
baths; they weaken and relax the skin. The difference between
bringing a great amount of heat to act upon the surface, and
causing the body to develop its own heat, must be obvious to
every one.</p>


<h3>XIV.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Sweating Process.</span></h3>

<p>This process is precisely the same as that which has been
already described, with the omission of the wet sheet. To
produce perspiration, the body is enveloped in dry blankets.
This tedious process in moderately strong people is seldom
effected in less than three hours.</p>

<p>In the wet sheet, <i>no</i> water is given&mdash;but in the blankets,
as soon as perspiration appears, it should be administered in
small quantities; for this purpose a tea-pot is desirable.</p>

<p>In the Sweating process it is necessary to place a urinal in
the bed of the patient. On proceeding to the bath after either
of the operations, the attendant must take especial care to
keep the body well covered, or his patient may take cold.
On throwing off the covering, let the body be wetted all over
instantly. This is an infallible precaution.</p>

<p>When there is a difficulty in procuring a bath, the dripping
sheet full of water is used. If the first sheet does not cool, it
must be repeated.</p>


<h3>XV.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Rubbing Sheet, or Abreibung.</span></h3>

<p>This, by some, is called &ldquo;the dripping sheet&rdquo;; by others,
&ldquo;the wrung out&rdquo; or &ldquo;rubbing sheet.&rdquo; The term &ldquo;rubbing&rdquo; is
used, because when the sheet is thrown on the body, great
rubbing is used outside of it. It is a quick and simple mode
of taking a general ablution; and, when frequently repeated,
proves most effectual in restoring or increasing the circulation.</p>

<p>The value of friction to the human body is too well known
to require observation. Hair gloves, hard brushes, or coarse
towels cause a glow and an elastic feeling, though if long
persevered in, they irritate and weaken the skin.</p>

<p>For the daily purposes of life, cold ablutions, and friction<span class="pagenum" title="51"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51"></a></span>
with dry cloths are sufficient; but to rouse the dormant energies,
to give vitality to the system or combat illness, something
more powerful is required.</p>

<p>The rubbing-sheet is a small sheet, soaked in cold water, and
afterwards wrung out. This the attendant throws over the
patient naked, who, standing up, receives it over his head and
shoulders. When thus completely enveloped, the attendant
rubs (outside the sheet) the back, loins, legs, and feet of the
patient, whilst he himself rubs his abdomen and chest. The
operation lasts about three minutes; the wet sheet is then replaced
by a dry one, and friction again renewed until the body
becomes quite dry; after which, if one rubbing-sheet only is
prescribed, a waist-bandage is put on, a glass of water drank,
and the invalid proceeds to take the air. If two or three
rubbing sheets are prescribed, after the first operation as just
described is over, the patient walks about the room in the dry
sheet, with no other covering, for four or five minutes, occasionally
approaching the window, which should be opened,
throwing open the slight covering, in order to expose his skin
to the air. The second and third rubbing-sheets are applied
as the first.</p>

<p>Rubbing-sheets being used to effect several objects, are
accordingly well wrung out, or not much wrung out, or scarcely
wrung out at all. The first are used where there is a great
want of vital energy, slow and languid circulation; the second
is the ordinary mode of using the rubbing-sheet; the third is
adopted where parties have lain in the packing-sheet or blankets
and have no bath to cool them afterwards. Where there is a
superabundance of heat, the rubbings are repeated perfectly
wet, until the body is cooled.</p>

<p>The Rubbing Sheet is one of the safest and most efficacious
appliances in the Water-cure. Every human body has in it 100&frac12;
degrees of heat; this is not diminished by the rubbing; by extracting
we increase. Whenever persons are unwell, no matter
the cause (except there may be eruptions on the body), a
Rubbing Sheet is advisable. Where patients have been too
exhausted to endure any other treatment, these sheets will
resuscitate them in an extraordinary way.</p>

<p>Priessnitz perceived that merely rubbing the body with a
damp and afterwards with a dry cloth was beneficial; but he
found that whilst one part was under the operation, the other<span class="pagenum" title="52"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52"></a></span>
was exposed to catching cold; this gave him the idea of the
Rubbing-Sheet, with which the whole body is covered at once.</p>

<p>As a general rule it is safe to begin the treatment of any
illness with these sheets; they refresh the invalid, often ward
off the complaint or develop the malady. In the cold stage
of intermittent fever these rubbings down are persevered in
until heat is produced; when the hot stage ensues, recourse is
had to packing sheets, tepid baths, etc.</p>

<p>Where there is an excess of caloric, and fever is not declared,
rubbing-sheets have a cooling effect, and often put an end to
the illness at once. Where there is a want of caloric, as in
ague, the Rubbing Sheets cause a determination of heat from
the interior to the surface, in the same way that friction, or
striking, brings heat out of matter. This may be elucidated by
rubbing any part of the body with snow&mdash;re-action instantly
ensues.</p>

<p>After great fatigue or a chill, or where persons have reason
to think they have caught cold, two or three of these rubbings-down
have an extraordinarily restorative effect.</p>

<p>They may be used by old or young, strong or weak, with
perfect impunity.</p>

<p>In lumbago or rheumatism, or where it is necessary to rouse
the vital energies, rubbing-sheets, four consecutively repeated,
four times a-day, are frequently prescribed. A friend of mine,
after getting wet whilst hunting, sat in his wet clothes, caught
cold, and died. I am fully persuaded, if he had applied the
Rubbing-sheets on getting home, the fatal result would have
been avoided.</p>

<p>In some cases where a patient exhibits great weakness,
languid circulation, and doubtful reaction, the sheet is wetted
in tepid water, and sometimes the body is subjected to the action
of cold by degrees, instead of being covered up at once, as
is the case with the dripping sheet. There are invalids who
cannot suffer anything cold to touch certain parts of their
bodies; in such cases the tender part may be covered with
a dry cloth, whilst the dripping sheet is applied, and the
sensitive portion approached by degrees.</p>


<h3>XVI.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Douche Bath.</span></h3>

<p>The douche, of all means employed, is the most powerful in<span class="pagenum" title="53"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53"></a></span>
stirring up, and removing humours from the position they
may have occupied for years. What is understood by a
&ldquo;douche,&rdquo; is a spring of water, conveyed by pipes through the
tops of small huts, from whence it falls in a stream about the
thickness of one&rsquo;s wrist.</p>

<p>At Gräfenberg, there are six douches in the forest, with the
falls of twenty feet, eighteen feet, and fifteen feet, respectively:
the douches for women have a fall of only twelve feet, but no
difference is made in the dimensions of the stream.</p>

<p>Patients are generally some time under the treatment before
being permitted to take the douche. The douche is a most
powerful stimulant.</p>

<p>As the sun by repulsion, brings heat out of matter,
so the douche, by repelling, brings heat out of the body, and
from the interior to the surface. It sets up a powerful action
in the system, and is an active and useful agent for the cure
of old-standing complaints. The douche should only be used
in conjunction with other treatment.</p>

<p>The douche is never had recourse to in acute attacks; it is
useful principally in chronic diseases. By its agency the body
is hardened, and caused to develop its own force; it strengthens
the skin, determines morbific matters to the surface by the
pores, and exercises a powerful action upon the muscles and
nervous system, by the action it provokes. In arthritic cases
and rheumatism, the relief thus afforded is marvellous. It
is so powerful a stimulant, that persons are frequently known,
on coming out of the douche, to declare that they feel as
much elation and buoyancy of spirits, as if they had been
drinking freely of champagne.</p>

<p>A douche should be at some distance from the abode of the
patient, because the necessary walk to it produces a glow of
heat, and renders the body in a better state to produce re-action:
no person should douche if cold or chilly.</p>

<p>The afflicted parts should be most exposed to the action of
the douche, though it must be received successively upon all
parts of the frame, except the head and face, unless otherwise
prescribed. It should be avoided on the abdomen and chest
when the latter is weak.</p>

<p>The douche ought to be discontinued when it produces
feverish symptoms, and commenced again when they cease.
The duration of it, in a general way, varies from two to five<span class="pagenum" title="54"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54"></a></span>
minutes, but is extended as the case may require, from fifteen
minutes to half an hour; the latter being ordered in very
especial cases.</p>

<p>An attendant waiting in the anti-chamber, throws a dry sheet
on the patient on his coming out from the douche, rubs him
dry, and puts on the waist bandage.</p>

<p>The time allotted for douching is two hours after breakfast,
or dinner, but this rule is not without an exception; some
patients, after their morning treatment, walk an hour, and then
proceed to the Douche before breaking their fast.</p>

<p>Patients ought to be most particular in observing their
doctor&rsquo;s orders in the use of the douche.</p>


<h3>XVII.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Shower Baths.</span></h3>

<p>These baths so much recommended by the faculty are not
used at Gräfenberg. Many persons in the habit of using them
complain of giddiness and head-ache. This arises from the
re-action upwards, which naturally results from their application.
As an ablution, a bath, or washing with wet towels is
preferable.</p>

<p>Mr. Priessnitz objects to the use of them, as parties take them
without previous preparation, or other adjuncts. Falling on
the head, they frequently cause congestion in that region.</p>


<h3>XVIII.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Sitz or Sitting Bath.</span></h3>

<p>By this is to be understood a hip bath: that used at Gräfenberg
is a small flat tub about seventeen inches in diameter and
twelve or thirteen inches deep; a common washing tub placed
against the wall will answer the purpose. The water in this
bath is seldom more than four to six inches deep, in which
the patient sits with his feet resting on the ground. No rule
can be laid down for the duration of this bath, as it is ordered
from ten minutes to an hour, and longer, depending upon the
effect it is intended to produce. It is sometimes prescribed
three or four times a day.</p>

<p>The sitting bath is of so much importance that where not
prescribed the case is considered an exception to the ordinary
rule of treatment. The sitting-bath cools and strengthens the
viscera of the body, and by revulsion or derivation, draws the<span class="pagenum" title="55"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55"></a></span>
humours from the head, chest, and abdomen; relieves pain in
the gums or face, and dissipates flatulency and cholic; and is
of the utmost value to those who lead sedentary lives.</p>

<p>The object of using so little water in this bath, the foot and
a half bath, is, that reaction may be the sooner effected. The
water is only changed in peculiar cases. The abdomen should
be well rubbed whilst taking the bath, and exercise taken
immediately after it, to bring on a reaction. Where there is any
tendency of heat or blood to the head, a wet bandage in the
shape of a turban should be put on the head immediately before
sitting in the bath, and continued the whole time. In commencing
the hydropathic treatment, or where the patient is low
spirited or unwell, or in cases where reaction is slow, a tepid
sitting bath of 62 deg. to 64 deg. is usually prescribed. If a
patient takes this bath immediately after the rubbing-sheet,
or the room in which he takes it is cold, he should be
covered with a cloak or dry blanket. Sitting baths must not
be taken just before going to bed, excepting under peculiar
circumstances.</p>

<p>In a case of asthma when the patient could hardly breathe, a
tepid sitting bath relieved him effectually in fifteen minutes.
In all cases of accidents to the head, evil consequences are
averted by repeated sitting baths. Head-aches are also
generally relieved by these baths, which shows to demonstration
that the theory of cold water when applied to the extremities
driving the blood to the head, is completely devoid of
foundation.</p>


<h3>XIX.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Eye Bath.</span></h3>

<p>As a preservative to the eyes, they should be kept open in
a basin of water for two or three minutes every morning, or
oftener. Glasses may also be used of the form of the eye, with
water in them. For weak eyes, they are applied two or three
times a day for five minutes each time. Where great inflammation
exists, water should be thrown with the hand into the
eyes several times a day.</p>


<h3>XX.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Head Bath.</span></h3>

<p>This bath can be taken in a common baking-dish, or any
shallow vessel that can be kept flat on the ground. To take<span class="pagenum" title="56"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56"></a></span>
this bath, place a rug or blanket on the ground, and at the end
of it, the vessel, containing water about two inches deep. The
patient should extend himself on the rug so that his head may
reach the dish or bason; then place the back of the head
in the water, and keep it there three or four minutes; then
each side of the head for the same time, and finish the operation
by again subjecting the back of the head to the bath for
two minutes. This process relieves headache. In cases of
brain fever, and other diseases which cause great heat or pain
in the head, these baths are frequently resorted to whilst the
patient is in bed,&mdash;the back part of the head of the patient
being placed in water, which is renewed when hot. In inflammation
of the eyes, deafness, or loss of smell and taste, these
baths are of great utility.</p>


<h3>XXI.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Finger and Elbow Baths.</span></h3>

<p>The wounded finger is placed in a glass of water; and there
are cases where a glass is affixed by a string to the wrist, and
the patient keeps the finger constantly in the bath. The elbow
bath is used whenever the hand is wounded: it draws off the
heat, and lowers the inflammation.</p>


<h3>XXII.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Leg Bath.</span></h3>

<p>The thighs and legs, when afflicted with ulcers, ringworms,
etc., ought to be put into a bath, so as to cover the parts
afflicted, for an hour or longer. This bath acts as a stimulant.</p>

<p>Other members of the body may likewise be subjected to
baths; but their necessity must, be determined by circumstances.</p>


<h3>XXIII.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Foot Bath.</span></h3>

<p>This bath acts derivatively, and is employed as a counteracting
agent against pains of the head, inflammation in the face, congestion
to the upper regions of the body, fainting fits, bleeding
of the nose, or spitting of blood.</p>

<p>Priessnitz prescribes cold foot-baths to effect the same object
that the faculty endeavour to promote by warm ones.</p>

<p>The difference between a cold foot-bath and a warm one is,<span class="pagenum" title="57"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"></a></span>
that after the cold one, a warm glow succeeds and remains;
whilst cold feet are the necessary consequence of a warm bath.
After the feet have been in cold water for some time, the
water becomes tepid from the heat extracted. If the feet are
put into hot water, heat, instead of being eliminated from the
system, is brought to it&mdash;the very opposite to what is intended.</p>

<p>Sometimes, water at a temperature of 62 degrees is prescribed.</p>

<p>Cold foot-baths are accused of driving the blood to the head,
for which notion there is not the slightest foundation, as the
very opposite effect always attends their application. In the
case of bleeding at the nose, I have seen them used several
times; two cases, in fact, are worthy of notice:&mdash;A man was
nearly exhausted from loss of blood from the nose; he put his
feet into cold water, and the bleeding stopped in two minutes.
A young lady, similarly attacked, put a key down the back
and a wet towel upon the nape of the neck, without effect;
her feet were put into cold water, and the bleeding ceased immediately.
These two cases ought to satisfy the inquirer that
cold foot-baths, far from causing congestion in the head, relieve
the head.</p>

<p>Care must, however, be taken that the feet are warm when
put into cold water, and exercise should be taken after the
bath, in order to bring about re-action.</p>

<p>To prove that re-action always attends the use of these
baths, when followed by proper exercise, we have but to observe
our feet an hour or two after using one. After great
fatigue a foot-bath is most refreshing. Mr. Priessnitz recommends
the frequent use of these baths, as calculated to ward
off complaints&mdash;many of which originate in the feet.</p>

<p>Friction and cold foot-baths are the best remedy for habitually
cold feet.</p>

<p>Poor people who wear neither shoes or stockings, and whose
feet are constantly exposed to a sort of foot-bath, avoid many
complaints with which the rich are visited. It would be a
misfortune to such people to be furnished with covering for
the feet, as will be seen by two cases supplied me by friends
on whom I can rely:&mdash;</p>

<p>An Irish gentleman, who removed a game-keeper from a
low marshy estate to one high and dry, asked him one day
how he liked the change. The man replied, <span class="pagenum" title="58"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58"></a></span>&ldquo;Not at all;
he had never been well a day since he had been there, for there
was not a drop of water to wet his feet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A game-keeper, sent to prison to wait his trial for killing a
man, being unwell, thought he would adopt his old habits
as far as his confinement admitted of. He frequently immersed
his feet in cold water, and kept them in motion.
Soon after he began this, he recovered.</p>

<p>As a general foot-bath, the water should only come up to
the instep; the feet and legs ought to be rubbed by an attendant,
or one foot rubbed against the other the whole time.
For cold feet ten minutes is sufficient, and the water need
only cover the soles of the feet; but for other objects these
baths are taken from fifteen minutes to half an hour, often
much longer.</p>


<h3>XXIV.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Tepid, or Abgeschrecte Bath.</span></h3>

<p>This bath is precisely the same as the half-bath, and applied
in the same way; the only difference being the water, which in
this bath is tepid; <i>i. e.</i> ordinarily 62 or 63 deg. of Fahrenheit,
sometimes as high as 76 deg. In ordinary cases eight or ten
minutes are sufficient, though in gout I have known it continued
for hours. Great friction, except in eruptive cases, is
applied the whole time.</p>

<p>The temperature during the use of this bath must be gradually
diminished by the addition of cold water. After rubbing
the body for a short time, the attendant throws a can of cold
water on the head and shoulders and then renews the friction,
a process repeated until inflammation and pain has subsided.
If the patient feels weak or tired under the operation, he is
allowed to come out for a few minutes and then begin again.
It is customary with Priessnitz to put all new-comers into a
tepid bath for one or two minutes, then into the cold plunge
bath and back to the tepid. By these means he judges of their
powers of re-action, and prescribes accordingly.</p>

<p>Tepid baths are always used in eruptive cases. All practitioners
would do well to begin with these baths and proceed
by degrees to colder ones. Every day&rsquo;s experience teaches
Priessnitz the value of tepid baths.</p>

<p>Whenever these baths are ordered&mdash;for instance for fifteen<span class="pagenum" title="59"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59"></a></span>
minutes&mdash;instead of taking the whole at once, the dose is
administered <i>à trois reprises</i>. After the first five minutes, the
patient gets out of the bath and walks about the room, covered
with a dry sheet, until he gains a little life and activity in the
joints, which will be effected in two or three minutes. He
then returns to the bath, and after the next five minutes
the same process is repeated. After the third process, the
patient is dried and walks about the room in the dry sheet for
a short time, by way of taking an air bath. This is an important
modification in the use of this bath. When patients
are feeble and not able to support a bath so long as is often
necessary to remove the attack, of whatever nature it may be,
by dividing it in the way described, nature recovers herself a
little during each rest, and the sufferer is thus enabled to take
the whole; whereas, without any such pauses, the demand
made on his strength might be too great. With children this
mode of treatment is particularly observed.</p>


<h3>XXV.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Bandages, or Umschlags.</span></h3>

<p>Bandages fulfil two objects diametrically opposed to each
other, viz., to calm and to stimulate. One object is effected
by leaving a good deal of water in the bandage, not covering
it with a dry one, and changing it as soon as hot. The other
by wringing the bandage well out, covering it with a dry
one and only changing it when dry.</p>

<div class="hangin">

<p>1st. The more heat there is in the intestines the quicker the
body bandages act.</p>

<p>2nd. Outward cold applications cause a fresh generation of
heat.</p>

<p>3rd. By keeping the skin moist, these bandages cause the
exudation of peccant humours and eliminate the excess
of caloric.</p>

<p>4th. They equalise the temperature of the intestines, and
keep up a healthy action in them.</p>

<p>5th. Wherever there is inflammation, their application and
renewal lowers the temperature, and their moisture
causes the healing of sores or wounds.</p></div>

<p>Those most in use, may be termed heating bandages. That
for the waist, is worn day and night. It is 8&frac12; feet long; eight
or nine inches wide, with a double tape at the end to tie it<span class="pagenum" title="60"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60"></a></span>
with. To be put on with facility, it ought to be rolled up like
a surgeon&rsquo;s bandage, beginning at the tape end. Then as much
should be wetted and wrung out as will go once round the
body, which the remaining part will cover. The chest bandages
are made of coarse linen, <i>doubled</i>, in the shape of a
breast-plate, to fit the chest and the throat, tied with three
pair of tapes, one round the neck, under the arms, and round
the waist. There must be two breast-plates, one to button
into the other: the smaller to be wetted, the larger to be dry.</p>

<p>In the water-cure the waist bandage is changed in the
morning, at noon, in the afternoon, and on going to bed.</p>

<p>A clammy heat almost immediately succeeds the application
of this bandage: a sensation which one soon becomes accustomed
to. Large or small bandages of this nature are applied
in an infinity of cases. Those afflicted with complaints of the
throat or chest, wear the chest bandage at night. Bandages
are also applied to the feet and legs as derivatives; and to all
wounds, bruises, diseased parts, or wherever pain is felt.</p>

<p>The humid heat of these bandages has a stimulating and
absorbent property; they relieve the body of superfluous heat,
and extract vitiated matters from the parts to which they are
applied, as is frequently seen by the water in which they are
washed. Moreover, they regulate the bowels, kidnies, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Mercury is constantly drawn from the pores in these bandages.&mdash;Prince
Leichtenstein, who had rubbed a light green
ointment into his leg twelve months previously to going to
Gräfenberg, found that for a fortnight it came out of the flesh
by means of these bandages. Some medical men are sceptical
on this subject: to be convinced of the truth let such go to
Gräfenberg, where they may have constant evidence of the
fact.</p>

<p>These bandages assuage pain, and aid in curing&mdash;better than
ointments and plaisters[sic]. It is in vain that we seek to cure
malignant ulcers retained in the system by impure blood with
ointments. At Gräfenberg this is effected by the general cure,
in which these bandages occupy so prominent a part.</p>

<p>These bandages are used by every patient, and must
be renewed after every application of the treatment. If not
mentioned in any of the following cases, the omission is unintentional,
and those for the waist and diseased parts must be
applied notwithstanding.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="61"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61"></a></span></p>

<p>To any one who has never been in a Water-cure establishment,
the application of these bandages will doubtless appear
fraught with danger; but so little is this the case, that they
are applied to age and decrepitude, to infants as soon as born,
and to persons of weak, nervous, and delicate constitutions.</p>

<p>So far from colds being produced by these bandages, when
covered with dry ones, we find invalids almost entirely encased
in them nightly for months together. Let any one in pain, or
who has a sore throat, try them, and he will soon be a convert
to our opinion.</p>

<p>In inflammation, congestion of the blood, head-aches,
burns, scalds, and wounds, until inflammation subsides,
bandages without dry ones over them are used.</p>

<p>For this purpose, linen several times doubled, is wetted in
cold water and placed upon the parts affected, where it remains
until hot, and then is renewed until the disease ceases for
which it was applied.</p>

<p>Sometimes these bandages are changed every ten minutes.
In cases of wounds or fractures, sitz-baths accompany these
bandages, as together they keep down inflammation.</p>

<p>In inflammation and fever, and in all cases of sickness,
discomfort, pain or cramps, a larger bandage than usual is
required: this is a sheet folded up and applied from the arm-pits
to the thighs, and changed frequently. This large
bandage is frequently ordered at night to sleep in, instead of
the smaller one.</p>

<p>A gentleman, greatly afflicted, was packed up at night in
a wet sheet, with a blanket loosely bound round him, his arms
and feet being left free. This afforded him relief from pain.
Of course, care was taken that perspiration did not ensue.
In the morning the patient took his usual treatment.</p>

<p>The following interesting fact, confirming the advantage of
bandages, is related in Baron Larry&rsquo;s &ldquo;Memoir of the Russian
Campaign.&rdquo; &ldquo;An officer underwent amputation of an arm,
after which the surgeon lost sight of him for some time. Two
years subsequently, he met the officer in the saloons of Paris,
who stated, that his wound had been completely cured by
the constant application of cold wet bandages, which he wetted
at the different rivulets he met with in his retreat, without
any other application whatever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In a Water-cure Establishment bandages are applied wherever<span class="pagenum" title="62"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62"></a></span>
pain or inconvenience is felt. Sometimes a patient has
his legs, thighs, loins, and perhaps an arm or his head encased
in them at one time, and so sleeps without any precautions as
to increasing the amount of his covering.</p>

<p>A well-known English Gentleman caught leprosy in the
East. Whilst under treatment at Gräfenberg, he slept in a
pair of wet pantaloons, and a wet waistcoat covered with dry
ones every night. The dry covering soon became wet, as did
the blanket, when the patient felt chilly and uncomfortable,
yet no cold resulted. The blanket which was used as a
covering attracted the humidity. Priessnitz ordered a second
blanket to be put over the first, which absorbed the damp from
the first. After a couple of hours this was taken off and the
under blanket was found dry: thus the patient was relieved of
his discomfort.</p>

<p>A Gentleman afflicted with Lumbago was advised to bathe
in the Serpentine in winter. After having done so, he dipped
his shirt in the water, wrung it out, and put it on, then
buttoning up well and putting on a great-coat and a large
neckcloth, he proceeded briskly to Hampstead and back; this
produced great heat, and cured the lumbago. These circumstances
lead to the conviction that dangers attending the
application of wet linen to our bodies, are less real than is
represented. Thus, the airing of linen before a fire previous
to wearing it, is of no advantage; the slight damp in it, on
the contrary, excites the skin, and is more beneficial than
otherwise.</p>

<p>One thing the reader&rsquo;s attention must be called to as an
incontrovertible fact. No person ever caught a cold or
suffered inconvenience from the application of wet sheets or
bandages in the Water-cure.</p>


<h3>XXVI.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Diet.</span></h3>

<p>&ldquo;It is not the plenty of meat,&rdquo; says Dr. Scott, &ldquo;that nourishes,
but a good digestion; neither is it the abundance of wealth
that makes us happy, but the discreet using of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Whilst under treatment, patients partake of three meals,
breakfast, dinner, and supper. The breakfast and supper
consist of bread, butter, milk and fruit. Dinner ought to<span class="pagenum" title="63"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63"></a></span>
consist of plain food, that is to say, roast and boiled meat,
poultry and vegetables, puddings and fruits; fish and soup are
not recommended.</p>

<p>Priessnitz is not an advocate for what is considered highly
nourishing food; he contends that quantity is more essential
than quality. The act of feeding causes the stomach, like
other members of the body, to perform its office.</p>

<p>A written case was presented to him of a person treating
himself. Priessnitz approved of what was doing, until he
came to where it was stated the patient ate roast beef and
mutton daily&mdash;through this he struck his pen. This opinion
of Priessnitz&rsquo;s seems confirmed by Dr. Beaumont of the United
States, who made some useful experiments upon a young man
named &mdash;&mdash;&nbsp;Martin, who was desperately, though not mortally,
wounded, by the discharge of a gun, the contents of which
entered the chest, and passed through the integuments of the
stomach, so that the whole process of digestion was laid open
to observation. The most important inferences arrived at by
the doctor, from his observations, were&mdash;</p>

<p>1st.&mdash;<i>That all stimulating condiments are injurious to the
healthy stomach.</i></p>

<p>2ndly.&mdash;<i>That the use of ardent spirits if preserved in, produces
disease in the stomach.</i></p>

<p>3rdly.&mdash;<i>That bulk as well as nutriment is necessary to the
articles of diet.</i></p>

<p>4thly.&mdash;<i>That the digestibility of aliment does not depend upon
the quantity of nutritient principles it contains.</i></p>

<p>Dr. Beaumont further adds, &ldquo;Here we have incontestable proof, that
disease of the stomach was induced, and going on from bad to worse, in
consequence of indulgence in ardent spirits, <i>although no prominent
symptom made its appearance</i>, and &mdash;&mdash;&nbsp;Martin was, in his
general habits, a healthy and sober man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I put the following questions to Mr. Priessnitz:&mdash;&ldquo;Is it
requisite to eat meat every day?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, whilst under the
treatment, because of the waste which the operations and
consequent exertions occasion.&rdquo; &ldquo;In cases of obstinate
constipation, animal food must be partaken of sparingly?&rdquo;
&ldquo;When not under Hydropathic treatment, meat should not be
indulged in every day, except where parties are subjected to great
exertion or hard labour, and even then it is better to avoid it<span class="pagenum" title="64"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64"></a></span>
occasionally. In fact, people would be more healthy if they
only eat meat on alternate days, and if all their food were cold
instead of hot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>From the habitual use of hot aliments the lining coat of
the throat and stomach becomes distended and weak&mdash;hence
bronchitis and weak digestion.</p>

<p>To the question as to drinking water. Priessnitz said, &ldquo;Drink
plentifully at every meal, finish by a tumbler or two, and
don&rsquo;t fail drinking five or six glasses daily.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Experience which is better than a thousand theories, proves
that after partaking of indigestible food, or eating too much,
a few glasses of water relieve the stomach. One is at a loss
to conceive why people should avoid drinking water at their
meals, since none suffer from its use, and Nature seems to
require it. Those who feel indisposed, by abstaining from
food altogether for a day and drinking water, may frequently
avoid a serious illness.</p>

<p>Butter is fat food and bad for delicate digestions. The
leaner the food the better, to restore tone to the stomach and
bowels. To people of strong digestions this does not apply.</p>

<p>If we look around us, we find that three-fourths of the
human family live and labour, and digest, without tasting
animal food; that the remaining fourth, who indulge in it, do
more homage to Apothecaries&rsquo; Hall than all the rest. But it
is argued, much depends upon climate: then how shall we
reconcile the rice of the East, the potato of Ireland, the oatmeal
of Scotland, and the rye-bread of Poland? We can
easily understand people in hot countries living upon rice,
maccaroni[sic], etc.; but if what we understand by the term, nutritious
food, is absolutely indispensable, how reconcile ourselves
to the potato as the only food for the largest portion of the
inhabitants of Ireland? Rye, which is the staff of life to the
Poles, is a grain next in degree to wheat; then follow barley
and oats. Potatoes are the very worst and lowest description
of food. Rye-bread is as manna sent from heaven, in comparison
with oatmeal, the chief food of the highlands of
Scotland; yet we see strong healthy people in Ireland and
Scotland, living solely upon these to a fine old age, without
the assistance of the Pharmacop&oelig;ia.</p>

<p>Does not this prove Mr. Priessnitz is right, when he says
quantity is more essential than quality?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="65"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65"></a></span></p>

<p>The great mass of mankind live on vegetable diet, which
comprehends all the products of the earth. An author tells us,
&ldquo;Recent discoveries have shewn that vegetables contain the
same elements as flesh: the same gluten, albumen, fibrin, and
oily matters that exist in a beefsteak, are also found in our
esculent vegetables.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Experience proves that vegetable diet is lighter and less
liable to bring on disease, than one in which animal food
largely prevails.</p>

<p>From an early period the philosophers of Greece,&mdash;from
amongst whom we may cite Zeno, Plutarch, Porphyrus, and
Plautinus,&mdash;advocated and practised an exclusively vegetable
diet. The Pythagorean sages inculcated the same: hence the
prevalence of rice diet over the vast and densely-peopled
regions of Asia. Mahomet is said to have lived upon dates
and water. It is related that the philanthropists, Swedenborg
and Howard, were vegetarians; that Newton, Descartes, Haller,
Hufeland, Byron, Shelley, and a host of other men of genius,
were advocates of a vegetable diet. The continued use of meat
produces scurvy, liver disease, rheumatism, gout, piles, etc.</p>

<p>Lamartine is a vegetarian.</p>

<p>On the score of economy, it is ascertained that the same plot
of ground which would provide animal food for one man,
would feed seventeen on vegetables.</p>

<p>For sick and delicate people, nutritious food should give
way to coarser fare when under treatment. Priessnitz says he
lost a colonel in the army, entirely from his indulgence in
niceties and nourishing food; he could not be induced to confine
himself to plain coarse fare: his digestion, in consequence,
was always impaired.</p>

<p>Salt is injurious when acid humours or sores affect the body.</p>

<p>All spices, such as pepper, cloves, cinnamon, and mustard,
are to be avoided, on account of their stimulating properties:
nature gave these stimulants to the Indians, because their
burning sky, by enervating the body, rendered them necessary.</p>

<p>In our climate the air is more compressed, and contains a
larger amount of oxygen, which predisposes to inflammatory
diseases. &ldquo;Use,&rdquo; says Priessnitz, &ldquo;the seasonings nature has
given us, and leave to foreigners theirs: nature has provided
for man&rsquo;s wants; our eatables ought, on that account, to agree
with us the better.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="66"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66"></a></span></p>
<p>Good household or brown bread is considered better than
white bread.</p>

<p>Beer, wine, and alcohols of all kinds, are interdicted, as
not assimilating with the food. It is a mistake to suppose
that such things assist digestion: they have a totally opposite
effect. Every museum of natural history exhibits substances
preserved in wine, spirits of wine, or spirits, which would be
dissolved in water.</p>

<p>A question arises, if, after having undergone the Water-cure,
it is requisite to pursue any particular regimen? To this it
may be answered, that those who continue a life of temperance
stand a better chance of enjoying health and happiness than
those who do not; but abstemiousness does not follow the
Water-cure as a matter of course, any more than it does
medical treatment. It is, however, necessary to abstain from
intemperance for a short time after leaving off the treatment,
or serious consequences may ensue.</p>

<p>To those who have passed the meridian of life, whose circulation
is languid, who have been accustomed to stimulants,
Mr. Priessnitz recommends the occasional use of light wines;
and in speaking of wine as an alterative, he admitted that
there could be no rule without an exception.</p>

<p>Tea and coffee attack the nerves. In my travels through
Ireland, I was shocked at the ravages made upon the weaker
sex by tea, the abuse of which has become a besetting sin.
Give two or three cups of strong tea to one unaccustomed to
it, and its effects will be evident upon the nervous system: in
most cases it will deprive the recipient of sleep. I have known
a strong man who, to cure headache, drank three or four cups
of strong black tea, who, a few hours afterwards, trembled
from head to foot. The same often attends the drinking of
coffee. Dr. Sir Charles Scudamore, in his work on Hydropathy,
states that Liebig, the best living chemical authority,
said that coffee impeded the digestion of food for one or two
hours, its carbonaceous principle requiring oxygen; and that
he looked upon green tea as a poison. Tea and coffee-drinkers
declare that neither affect them, and refer to persons who have
drank both during a long life, and are, notwithstanding, in
health. There are exceptions. The Bacchanalian, in like
manner, justifies his revels, and the Turk his opium&mdash;but
<span class="pagenum" title="67"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67"></a></span>&ldquo;<i>mark the end!</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Stomachs weakened by the continued use of stimulants
revolt at milk, which is the only food of most animals when
young, and, as such, contains a large amount of nutriment,
which is not the case with tea or coffee. I know a lady, the
wife of one of Napoleon&rsquo;s marshals, who, for some complaint,
was prescribed a milk diet. During a period of twenty years
she has not taken an ounce of anything in the shape of food,
having confined herself entirely to milk. Her health has
been invariably good, and, though no longer young, can endure
an excursion on foot over the mountains of Switzerland
better than any of my female acquaintances. Does not this speak
volumes in favour of milk as a diet for children or adults?</p>

<p>At Gräfenberg, patients who cannot drink milk mix it with
water until the stomach gains tone; others drink sour milk,
and find it agree with them, when common milk would not:
this is to be accounted for from the milk having already undergone
the first process of fermentation, which process would
otherwise have taken place in the stomach. Most new-comers
to Gräfenberg have a strong prejudice against sour milk, which,
after persevering in taking it for some time, generally ends in
their liking it exceedingly. Sour milk, with sugar and strawberries,
is delicious. Boiled milk, with bread broken in it,
agrees with most people, and makes a nourishing meal. To
those with whom milk alone does not agree, cocoa, with plenty
of milk, is recommended as wholesome and economical.</p>

<p>It has been observed by an able writer, that some people
think that to live well means only to eat, and, it might be added,
to drink. To hear that a man can enjoy the pleasures of the
table, who refrains from wine and beer, and whose only beverage
is water, appears paradoxical. Some go so far as to say
that they prefer death to purchasing life on such terms, forgetting
that a temporary indulgence at the table for a couple
of hours may render them uncomfortable for the remainder of
the twenty-four, and that the exciting, overcharging, and
thickening of the blood, renders them hypochondriacal and
morose, and makes invalids of men who ought to be in the
enjoyment of robust health. It is hardly to be expected that
nature will deal mercifully with him who has for so many
years sinned against her mandates: she will, doubtless, sooner
or later reward the crimes of <i>lèse majesté</i> committed against
her high prerogatives.</p>

&ldquo;Nothing like the simple element dilutes<br />
The food, or gives the chyle so soon to flow.&rdquo;<br />
</div>


<p>The <i>bon-vivant</i>, from the excited state of his system, is not
only more subject to complaints than persons who live temperately,
but is more difficult of cure. When overtaken with
pain and illness, notwithstanding his stoicism in declaring for
a short life and a merry one, no one desires to be restored to
health with greater earnestness, or manifests a more ardent
clinging to life than himself.</p>

<p>Priessnitz&rsquo;s assumption that the indigenous products of the
country wherein we reside being best calculated for the support
of health, is borne out by Liebig, who says: &ldquo;Even when
we consume equal weights of food in cold and warm countries,
infinite wisdom has so arranged that the articles of food of
different climates are most <i>un</i>equal in the proportion of carbon
they contain. The fruits on which the natives of the South
prefer to feed, do not, in the fresh state, contain more than 12
per cent. of carbon; whilst the bacon and train oil used by the
inhabitants of the Arctic regions, contain 66 to 80 per cent. of
carbon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Avoiding all excess, it is man&rsquo;s prerogative to elaborate and
assimilate the most heterogeneous aliments, not being limited,
like other animals, to any particular food; and it is certain
that those who approach nearest to nature, who enjoy the
benefit of pure air and lead an active life, do not require to
observe any particular rules.</p>

<p>One thing, however, is admitted: the duration of life depends
upon the simplicity of our wants. Most people eat too
much, especially of animal food. No people talk so much of
indigestion, dyspepsia, and constipation, as the English; it has
been said that they take more pills and aperients, and pay
more fees, than all the nations of the world together! What
a distinction from savage life! The child of nature, whose
only drink is water, can, without inconvenience, go for days
together without food, and then commit excesses that, if
indulged in in civilised life, would produce fatal results.</p>

<p>It ought to be observed, that abstinence from wine and
spices is compensated by the pleasure water-drinkers take in
being enabled to partake <i>ad libitum</i>, of pastry, fruit, and other
delicacies of the table, which wine-drinkers dare not indulge in.</p>

<h3>XXVII.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Clothing, Air Baths, Wearing Stays, etc.</span></h3>

<p>Mr. Priessnitz expects all his patients to leave off wearing
flannel or cotton next to the body; he maintains that by keeping
up too much heat, they weaken the skin, which then is
less efficient in performing its offices, and in consequence people
become delicate and diseased.</p>

<p>A patient coming out of the bath, on being prevented putting
on his flannel waistcoat and drawers, said, &ldquo;Tell Mr.
Priessnitz, they and I having been intimately acquainted for
twenty years, I hardly like parting with them so abruptly.&rdquo;
His reply was, &ldquo;They are false friends; in a short time your
skin will regain the proper tone which they deprived it of, when
you will be warmer without flannel than ever you were with
it.&rdquo; Priessnitz does not preach one doctrine and practise
another&mdash;he wears nothing under his linen. Some patients of
a slow circulation, on commencing the treatment, are ordered
to wear their flannel waistcoats over their linen for a few
days: the want of it is not felt. It might naturally be supposed,
that leaving off flannel of a sudden, especially in cold
weather, would be attended with serious consequences; but
this is never the case in the Water-cure. Invalids frequently
arrive at Gräfenberg in the depth of winter, and after the bath,
invariably leave off flannel. Of the number of cases that came
under my observation, I never knew a single instance of a party
catching cold. After the bath, the patient is expected to keep
up a brisk walk for some time. In winter, it would be as
well, after leaving off flannel, to clothe warmer than usual for
a day or two.</p>

<p>Wearing flannel waistcoats in bed of a night is greatly debilitating.
An almost universal prejudice exists in favour of
flannel in cases of gout and rheumatism; hence the question
arises, &ldquo;Does it prevent or cure those complaints?&rdquo; Certainly
not; for where do you see their victims without flannel? Experience
proves, that it neither protects the wearer from disease,
nor allays pain.</p>

<p>Nightcaps destroy the hair, cause its premature decay, and
have an injurious tendency to those troubled with congestion
in the head, head-aches, etc.; such people cannot have their
bedrooms too cold. There is much sense in the old adage<span class="pagenum" title="70"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70"></a></span>&mdash;&ldquo;Keep
the head cold, and the feet warm.&rdquo; Previously to sleeping
without a nightcap, and washing my head every morning
with cold water, I was constantly tormented with cold in the
head, from which I am now perfectly free. Perhaps, in some
measure, I am indebted to my last visit to Gräfenberg for this
happy change, having passed a whole winter there without
wearing either hat or neck-cloth, or making any change from
my summer clothing, although the thermometer was frequently
12° to 14° Reaumur below zero.</p>

<p>The constant use of oils and pomatums to the hair, unless
the head is often washed, closes the pores, and is prejudicial.</p>

<p>With respect to the clothing, Priessnitz advises &ldquo;when in an
open carriage, or sitting still, the body should be well clothed;
when in exercise, as lightly covered as possible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>One half the cases of consumption in females may be traced
to the wearing of stays, and lacing them too tight. All artists
agree, that stays in growing people destroy, rather than improve,
the figure. Bound up in whalebone, they lose that graceful
undulation of the back which is so pleasing. Every one
who has seen the Venus de Medicis, Canova&rsquo;s Venus, or any
other faithful copy of nature, must consider a very small waist
a defect.</p>

<p>Stays, at best, are unwholesome, as they keep up an unnatural
heat about the body; and when laced too tight, are sure to be
attended with serious consequences. I have known several
young ladies, whose teeth were destroyed, whose breaths were
intolerable, and who were consigned to a premature grave,
entirely from tight lacing. To have health, the greatest of all
blessings, the complicated machinery inside our bodies must
have room for action (the intestinal canal, for instance, is half
as thick as a man&rsquo;s arm, and sixty or seventy yards long);
contract this space, you contract the vessels, and irregularity
of the functions ensues. This is an offence against nature,
which sooner or later she will repay with misery and pain.</p>

<p>Dr. Abernethy advised air baths, that is, the habit of exposing
the body naked to the air, which may be done with impunity
after the cold bath, but not otherwise. In winter,
instead of increasing the amount of clothing, Priessnitz advises
exercise; for, in proportion as the body is warmly clothed, and
the air excluded, the less warmth is produced by the body itself;
resistance to cold causes the body to bring forth its own energies<span class="pagenum" title="71"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71"></a></span>
and powers. There can be no doubt the feet are much warmer,
and that it is much healthier, to go without stockings; it necessitates
washing the feet oftener, which, if done in cold water,
tends to bring warmth to them. The Turks owe much of their
health to their habit of washing their feet. Before going to
Gräfenberg, people destitute of shoes and stockings excited my
pity; but since that time, my opinion is changed: let such
persons be well fed, but for health keep their feet bare. The
following extracts from Liebig support Priessnitz&rsquo;s opinion:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our clothing is merely an equivalent for a certain amount
of food. The more we are clothed, the less urgent becomes
the appetite for food; because the loss of heat by cooling, and
consequently the amount of heat to be supplied by the food,
is diminished.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If we were to go naked, like certain savage tribes; or if in
hunting or fishing, we were exposed to the same degree of cold
as the Samoyedes, we should be able with ease to consume ten
pounds of flesh, and perhaps a dozen of tallow candles into the
bargain, daily; as warm-clad travellers have related with
astonishment of those people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Englishman, in Jamaica, feels with regret the disappearance
of his appetite, previously a source of frequently
recurring enjoyment. And he succeeds by the use of cayenne
pepper and the most powerful stimulants, in enabling himself
to take as much food as he was accustomed to eat at home. But
the whole of the carbon thus introduced into the system is not
consumed; the temperature of the air is too high, and the oppressive
heat does not allow him to increase the number of
respirations by active exercise, and thus to proportion the waste
to the amount of food taken; disease of some kind, therefore,
ensues.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The cooling of the body, by whatever cause it may be
produced, increases the amount of food necessary, the mere exposure
to the open air, in a carriage or on the deck of a ship, by
increasing radiation and evaporation, increases the loss of heat
and compels us to eat more than usual. The same is true of
those who are accustomed to <i>drink large quantities of water</i>,
which is given off at a temperature of the body 98°. It
increases the appetite; and persons of weak constitution find it
necessary, by continued exercise, to supply to the system the
oxygen required to restore the heat abstracted by the cold<span class="pagenum" title="72"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72"></a></span>
water. Loud and long continued speaking, the crying of
infants, and moist air, all exert a decided and appreciable influence
on the amount of food which is taken.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Liebig.</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;No isolated fact,&rdquo; says Dr. Johnson, &ldquo;can contravene the
law that the quantity of food is regulated by the number of
respirations, by the temperature of the air, and by the amount
of heat given off to the surrounding medium, as for instance
by frequent bathing. Of course it is a matter of indifference
whether that medium be cold air or cold water.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As a healthy naked body generates by heightened perspiration
of the skin, the same warmth as is produced by one which
is covered, by means of retaining the perspiration; so every
one who is quite well, might by use become so hardened,
that during the coldest season he might feel, when naked, as
comfortable as any one covered with wool. The truth of this
was verified by two English gentlemen, the winter I spent
at Gräfenberg. One day in December, when the thermometer
was at 6°, of Reaumur, below zero, they proceeded to a mountain,
took off all their clothes, except their drawers, and proceeded to
the top, where, though the wind was blowing strong at the
time, they remained two hours. They stated that after they
had walked briskly, or got up the steam for ten minutes, a
glow of heat came on, which counteracting the cold, produced
the most agreeable sensation. Neither of these gentlemen
caught cold or suffered in any way from this experiment.</p>

<p>The Scotch Highlander with his naked legs, does not feel
colder, surrounded by mountains of ice, than we do who are
clothed. We prove this by our bare faces in the coldest
winter.</p>

<p>As the skin performs the double function, of drawing
nourishment from the air, and exhaling the phlogisticised air
of the diseased matter and worn-out atoms of the body, it
follows that the true art of curing, must be to endeavour to
restore these two functions. Hydropathy causes the ejection
of diseased matter and revives the activity of the skin.</p>

<p>Dr. Johnson observes, &ldquo;Discomforts are the necessary whips
and spurs which keep the living energies awake; whilst comforts
operate upon us like opiates: since to acquire a &lsquo;comfort&rsquo;
is only to remove a discomfort; and to remove what keeps
us awake, is the same thing as to administer what will send us
to sleep. The indulgences, therefore, wherewith even young<span class="pagenum" title="73"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73"></a></span>
and healthy men indulge themselves; the &lsquo;comforts,&rsquo; as they
call them, of flannel, warm clothing, closed doors, carpeted
rooms, soft beds, hot food, are infinitely worse than absurd;
because the opposites of all these luxuries, so far from being
injurious to health, are absolutely <i>necessary</i> to it. We actually
kill ourselves with comforts.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>XXVIII.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Drugs.</span></h3>

<div class="poemcenter">
&ldquo;Thus with our hellish drugs, Death&rsquo;s ceaseless fountains<br />
In these bright vales, o&rsquo;er these green mountains<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Worse than the very plague we raged.</span><br />
I have myself to thousands poison given,<br />
And hear their murderer praised as blest by heaven,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Because with Nature strife he waged.&rdquo;</span><br />
<span class="smcap ml20em">Göethe&rsquo;s Faust.</span>
</div>

<p>The influence of habit and custom is such, that it is difficult
to arouse inquiry, when the result is calculated to derange
the existing order of things. Mr. D&rsquo;Israeli observes, &ldquo;Could
we conceive that man had never discovered the practice of
washing his hands, but cleansed them as animals do their
paws, he would for certain have ridiculed and protested
against the inventor of soap, and as tardily, as in other
matters, have adopted the invention.&rdquo;</p>

<p>All change, however beneficial, is attended with trouble;
and we therefore adopt the motto, &ldquo;Whatever is, is right.&rdquo;
This very motto is the key to our method of cure&mdash;as it is to
that of every other great moral truth. Yet, to quote the
words of Rausse, &ldquo;We do not take this in the sense of the
philosophy of our days, or in that of the German philosopher,
Hegel, for then we must consider falsehood and assassination
to be good. Rather would we take these words in the sense
in which they were first proclaimed by the philosophy of
Geneva, in the sense in which the <i>first citizen</i> used them for
the foundation of his truths; thus, that which is produced by
nature is good; all inclinations, all impulses of men derived
from nature, are good; and every mis-usage of nature is an
outrage which she punishes with misery and pain. All the
principles of the art of curing at Gräfenberg, attested as they
are by thousands, are dictated by that instinct which nature
has given to every human being as his inheritance.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="74"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74"></a></span></p>
<p>But are not all the cures performed at Gräfenberg&mdash;all the
doctrines of Hydropathy&mdash;opposed to science? It may be
answered, Yes; nor can we shut our eyes to the fact, that
nature refuses all respect for what we are pleased to denominate
learning&mdash;nay, tramples upon what is often called science:
particularly on that of medicine. By what delusions were
mankind first persuaded to submit to the use of poisonous
drugs! In the middle ages, water as a beverage, and as a
cure for disease, fell into total disuse. In the time of the
Crusades, the Arab doctors introduced the use of Oriental
drugs, to which they attributed miraculous virtues; and during
the period of astrology and alchemy, and when researches
were being made for the philosopher&rsquo;s stone, almost every nation
boasted of having found some panacea&mdash;some elixir vitæ:
sometimes it was an oil or an herb; at others, a powder or
mineral; until, in process of time, their accumulation formed
the vaunted science of medicine. But, we would inquire, are
the effects of these compounds such as to lead to the conclusion
that they were recommended by nature? Have mankind
become healthier since their introduction? Are those nations
who have done most homage to this science, the strongest and
soundest?</p>

<p>To think of eradicating disease with poisons, of which
physic is generally composed, appears paradoxical. How is
it possible to bring physic to bear upon the dispersed and
deeply-hidden diseased matter? Even if this could be done,
it is quite impossible, as every chemist knows, for the peccant
matters and physic to dissolve each other into nothing.</p>

<p>Dr. Forbes, editor of the &ldquo;British and Foreign Medical
Review,&rdquo; supports this view of the case. He observes, &ldquo;It is
one of the most formidable difficulties with which the ordinary
physician has to contend, that nearly all his remedies reach
the point to which they are directed, through one channel.
If the brain requires to be placed under the influence of a
sedative or a stimulant, if the muscular system demands
invigorating by tonics, if the functions of organic life need
correction by alteratives, the physician has no means of attaining
his object except by inundating the stomach and bowels
with foreign and frequently pernicious substances. It being
thus made the medical doorway to all parts of the system,
and so compelled to admit every description of therapeutical<span class="pagenum" title="75"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75"></a></span>
appliances, the organ of digestion is contorted to a purpose
for which it was never intended.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The consequence,&rdquo; says Dr. Arbuthnot, &ldquo;of such treatment
with physic is, that to the old evil a new stimulus is
added, weak or strong, according to the dose and quality:
what is inflammable, stays in the blood, and afterwards affects
the brain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We may fairly ask, How can any of these consequences result
from Hydropathy? The following lines of Horace Smith
are not far from the truth:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poemcenter">
&ldquo;Physic! a freak of times and modes,<br />
Which yearly old mistakes explodes<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For new ones still absurder.</span><br />
All slay,&mdash;their victims disappear,<br />
And only leaves the doctrine clear<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That killing is no murder.&rdquo;</span><br />
</div>

<p>Are those who do most to aid the apothecaries, and who
indulge in alcoholic drinks, healthier than others; or, are those
who are in the habit of consulting doctors free from pain?
No! they drag on a miserable existence. It might be asked, If
certain herbs and minerals were alone intended for healing
man&rsquo;s infirmities, how would the inhabitants of the temperate
zone procure those that are indigenous to the tropics, and
<i>vice versâ</i>? Instinct pleads in favour of the element that
abounds wherever human beings ought to live; and innumerable
instances might be adduced of the advantage which the
use of water gives the savage over cultivated man.</p>

<p>From the most remote ages, water was known and resorted
to as a curative agent by the unsophisticated children of nature.
In the wilds of America, the savage is put into a close
hut, built of stones, which hut is heated to produce intense
perspiration on the invalid, in which state he is immersed in
the river, near to which the hut is generally placed; and by
Pallme&rsquo;s travels in Kordofan, we find that, in the very depths
of Africa, fevers are cured by cold water. It appears our
traveller lay several days in bed with burning fever, when, at
length, his attendants lifted him out of bed, placed him with
his back against the door, and poured a large volume of cold
water on his head and body. After the shock he was put to
bed, covered with sacks and sheepskins: this produced relief<span class="pagenum" title="76"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76"></a></span>
and sleep. A second application of this treatment effected a
cure.</p>

<p>Some writers err in supposing mankind to have arrived at
an age of decrepitude, from its not occurring to them that the
deterioration of health arises from art, and not nature. If you
wish to be convinced of this, leave civilised and go to savage
life. There you will see the man of nature as young and
strong as the first created; the generation cannot grow old,
except by art, poison, or vice. Prescribe simple water, and it
is rejected with scorn; but let any quack recommend his drugs,
however poisonous, and they are swallowed regardless of
results. It must have been the enemy of all good who first
persuaded mankind that poison could produce health.</p>

<p>The evils that arise from pernicious drugs, which have
swept away millions, and which will destroy the whole species
if no reform takes place, originate in misunderstanding the
first or acute attack, which is but an attempt of nature to
heal. Men take acute attacks for disease, whilst <i>in reality they
are the means by which the system is relieved of disease</i>. Bleeding,
blistering, cupping, and drugging, subdue these efforts,&mdash;not
by emancipating the system, but by so reducing it
that it can no longer contend with its enemy. Men
praised the unlucky discovery, and hence a host of deadly
diseases took their origin, such as destructions and suppurations
of the inner organs, dropsy, etc.: complaints which
were hardly known in times of yore, and which, but for
these causes, would never have reared their heads. However,
as the lamentable consequences in some cases do not
appear until years after the suppression of the acute conflict,
no one thinks of attributing them to drugs. This drug-plague
is the most dreadful malady mankind has to contend with;
dug by themselves from the black abysses of the earth, it
has been cherished as the effect of deep science for centuries;
how frequently has the last shilling been offered up at its
altar! Upon it as many millions have been spent as would pay
off the National Debt: to the study of these dangerous errors,
millions of men have applied the whole of their lives and their
ability: backed by this so-called science, they contend against
nature; but <i>how</i> does Nature punish those who wish to master
her? Oh, great unspeakable Nature! how dreadfully beautiful
art thou, in thy inexorable and destroying severity!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="77"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77"></a></span></p>

<p>Mankind may still turn back, and regenerate health; but it
is not sufficient for them to renounce physic: they must
abandon wine, spirits, and poison, in every shape. For the
curing of disease, we must not look into the grey mysteries of
the future, but far behind us, on the green plain of Nature,
and of the times which are past.</p>


<h3>XXIX.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Assimilation.</span></h3>

<p>The preservation of life requires not only that its consumption
should be reduced, but its restoration rendered more easy.
For this purpose two things are necessary, the perfect assimilation
of that which is beneficial, the separation from that which
is injurious. Life, as will be seen from the following definition,
depends upon the identification, the assimilation, and the
animalisation of external matter by the vital power, in its
passage from the chemical to the organic world.</p>

<p>The power of assimilating other substances into itself is the
fundamental principle of nature. This impulse and power is
not only prevalent in all organic matter, but also in elemental
bodies, that is to say, water, earth, and fire. The globe in the
beginning was a rigid rock, upon which air and water effected
their power of assimilation.</p>

<p>Assimilation is only possible by dissolving. For the purpose
of assimilation, air and water dissolved the earth&rsquo;s crust; by the
agency of those powers that surface originated which produces
and nourishes all organic bodies. As these exist in the
same world in which the elements continually exercise their
power of dissolving and assimilating, it follows, that from the
beginning there must have been developed in all organic
elements the same power, as a protection to themselves.</p>

<p>Air dissolves water into vapours, in order to assimilate gases
from it. Water extracts from air the oxygen gas.</p>

<p>Fire absorbs the oxygen of air, dissolves water into its two
component parts, hydrogen and oxygen, and by converting
the former to a flame, transforms water to fire; air absorbs
many gases which fire releases from combustibles; air draws
gases from the soil, the soil absorbs the oxygen of the air. In
this way the elements are in a constant conflict, each endeavouring
to dissolve the other, and to assimilate its matters with
itself. Organic bodies draw oxygen from the air by the process<span class="pagenum" title="78"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78"></a></span>
of respiration, which is also the property of plants: these draw
all assimilatory matter which the earth offers by their roots.
The same process is performed by animals feeding on plants or
herbs; whereas, on the contrary, fire resolves all organic matter
into its original elements. This same process is carried out by
water and air, with all organic beings, but as long as these are
living they only get their evaporation, and after death their
entirety. The earth exercises this power but conditionally and
partially, viz. upon all animals that exist in it, and on all roots
of plants; upon mankind the earth only exercises its power of
assimilation after death. The proofs of this conflict of assimilation
in organic matter itself are clear, one animal eats the
other as well as plants; that is to say, it absorbs by the agency
of the stomach so much of their substance as may be assimilated.
Plants again convert parts of dead bodies and other plants (the
manure) into their own substance.</p>

<p>Besides this power of assimilation, there exists in every
being, element and organisation, the necessity of being exposed
to foreign assimilation.</p>

<p>This is the fundamental principle of the true doctrine of
healing. In support of this theory, we find that water, if withdrawn
from the power of dissolution by the fresh air, stinks and
putrefies. Air loses its oxygen and becomes mephitic, if it
does not find water or plants with which it can enter into the
conflict of dissolution and assimilation.</p>

<p>Animals and plants fall ill and die if their surface is so
covered that neither air nor water can act upon them. If
nourishment is withdrawn from any organic being, that is to
say, if it is deprived of the opportunity of assimilating with
external or foreign substances, death is caused by the want of
a supply of healthy juices; if, on the contrary, this being is
deprived of the influence or effect of this foreign power of
dissolution, illness is the consequence, arising from the putridity
of matter, from which putridity the system ought to have been
released by the agency of foreign assimilation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="79"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79"></a></span></p>


<h3>XXX.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Crisis.</span></h3>

<div class="poemcenter">
&ldquo;Most blessed water! neither tongue can tell<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The blessedness thereof, nor heart can think,</span><br />
Save only those to whom it hath been given<br />
To taste of that divinest gift of heaven.<br />
<br />
&ldquo;I stoop&rsquo;d and drank of that divinest well,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Fresh from the Rock of Ages where it ran,</span><br />
It had a heavenly quality to quell<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">All pain: I rose a renovated man;</span><br />
And would not now, when that relief was known<br />
For worlds the needful suffering have forgone.&rdquo;<br />
</div>

<p>To those unaccustomed to the Water-cure treatment, the
Crisis is looked upon as something beyond human endurance;
but by those who understand the nature of it, its arrival is
hailed with joy, as the forerunner of a favourable termination
to their sufferings. A Crisis has a two-fold object, the restoration
of the animal functions to the condition of health, and
the cure of a disease. It is not therefore a necessary consequence
of the treatment; since, if there be no disease, the body
is free from vitiated matter, and no eruption can appear; but
if noxious matters exist in the system, whatever temporary
relief be obtained by drugs or ointment, no permanent beneficial
effect can be produced until they are extracted. Otherwise,
original health, that is, the same muscular power and
elasticity of body proportionately dealt out to all animals, will
never be obtained during the life of an individual. Nature,
to effect the elimination of non-nutritious matter, may resort to
measures imperceptible to the patient, such as evaporation
caused by ablutions, by relaxation of the bowels, or other
evacuatory means. Although for twelve months, whilst at
Gräfenberg, I went through all the necessary processes, I
never had any perceptible crisis, except a slight water-rash,
and the same may be said of many friends of mine, who have
passed through the treatment.</p>

<p>There is a critical period, if the treatment is persevered in:
it is when Nature is about to resume her power over the disease,
the latter having been attacked, and seeking to escape. It may
be compared to a tiger which a man is tempting in his lair: for
a time, it lies dormant, occasionally giving signs of existence,
when suddenly the animal rouses, and a violent struggle ensues.<span class="pagenum" title="80"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80"></a></span>
The man however proves the strongest of the two. In all future
attacks too, which are less vigorous, the tiger is defeated, until
he finally quits his lair, and flies from his human conqueror.
Thus at last are old diseases eradicated. In acute cases, the
first rencontre often settles the affair.</p>

<p>Under the Water-cure it frequently happens that every evil
and pain is increased in intensity from the fact of the strength
being always progressing. The weak and debilitated feel little
pain; feebleness has produced insensibility. As the vital force
diminishes, in the same proportion are the symptoms less violent;
but when strength and vigour are daily gaining ground,
so do the symptoms become more vigorous and intense. Nature
is in a state of revolution; and, by being reinstated in her
rights, she has declared war with all foreign powers that
ventured to invest her citadel, and trample upon her rights
and laws during the period of her prostration.</p>

<p>An officer in the Prussian army, author of the most concise
and best-written work on the Water-cure, told me that at
Gräfenberg six years ago he was radically cured of a complication
of diseases: that he had the so-called crisis; the first
attack was painful and distressing in the extreme; rheumatism
returned to each part where he had previously felt it; his foot,
which some years before had been trodden upon by a horse,
became exceedingly painful; his hands and feet swelled to
double their ordinary size, and there was a discharge of an
offensive nature from them. This lasted for about ten days.
In the course of his cure he had two other attacks, each inferior
in intensity to the preceding one. After the last, he found
his hearing, of which he had been deprived two years, restored;
he could walk as well as ever he did, a necessary
pleasure of which rheumatism had deprived him; in fact, he
left Gräfenberg a new man, and has ever since been perfectly
well. This gentleman said that, whilst in a fortress, with his
regiment, almost all the officers, except himself, suffered from
influenza, whilst he escaped, from drinking cold water and
taking several ablutions a day.</p>

<p>When a crisis is expected, Priessnitz increases the treatment,
as he also does when it has made its appearance: instead of
discouraging the crisis to proceed, he encourages it by all
the means in his power. So that eruptions, boils, fever,
diarrh&oelig;a, inflammation, or aught else brought out by the treatmen<span class="pagenum" title="81"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81"></a></span>t,
may be gradually reduced by it. In this stage of the
Water-cure, no compromise can be made; the fight must be
continued until the enemy quits the field.</p>

<p>A lady of my acquaintance, on the appearance of an eruption,
gave up the treatment until it disappeared; the eruption
took an inward direction and inflammation of the lungs was
the consequence: the most vigorous measures were now resorted
to by Priessnitz, or her life would, most probably, have paid
the forfeit. Another lady was treating herself to great advantage.
After some time, when some boils made their appearance,
she became uneasy and low-spirited. Alarmed, she left
off the cure; the boils receded, and a fever succeeded them,
which, as she could not procure advice, ended in a painful
illness. When hydropathy was first introduced into England,
the death of a clergyman, who had been treated by it, caused
a great sensation. This gentleman went to an establishment
on the Rhine, where he staid two or three months: on his
determining to leave, the doctor, who saw indications of a
Crisis, advised him to stay. The patient disregarded this
advice and proceeded home; when, as predicted, a number of
boils appeared. Mistaking these friends for enemies, he sent for
a medical man, who declared the boils to arise from poverty of
the blood, administered something to cause them to retire, and
advised him to drink wine and beer, and live freely. As might
have been expected, the result was fatal.</p>

<p>Had this gentleman been subjected to the Packing-sheet
followed by Tepid-bathing; and had the boils been constantly
bandaged, his health would, doubtless, have been improved.</p>

<p>I have known patients, whose blood was in an unhealthy
state, throw out boils for months; but who, from constantly
applying bandages to them, suffered but little inconvenience.</p>

<p>At some of the establishments in Germany, when a crisis is
indicated, it is the practice to recommend patients to diminish
the treatment or quit it altogether, thus throwing away the
golden opportunity of realising health. Whilst at others with
a limited knowledge of the Hydropathic treatment, some
practitioners resort to Allopathic or Homoæpathic means of
mitigating nature&rsquo;s effort to escape her bonds. Let not such
men be trusted: they know not what they do. When in
Ireland, I treated a person of advanced age who had been
confined to bed for twelve months. In two days he was able<span class="pagenum" title="82"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82"></a></span>
to walk out on crutches. After I left, a large boil came in
his back: not understanding the matter he gave up the treatment.
Instead of the boil being forced to a head, it retired,
and he fell into his old state. Had this boil been encouraged to
a large size, the patient would, after its bursting, have felt much
relief.</p>

<p>It is a common practice, under medical treatment, to open a
boil, and thus put an end to it&mdash;a quick method, no doubt,
of affording relief; but the morbific matters that could have
accumulated there, and been eliminated by it, remain in the
system. Fevers again, under our medical treatment, are suppressed;
whilst in the Water-cure, the morbific heat is extracted
by the pores, and the whole system cooled through the
medium of the mucous membrane or skin.</p>

<p>It is in a crisis, that the mind of the great Water-king is
made manifest. Such is the unbounded confidence of patients
in him, that most of them ardently desire to pass through this
ordeal. It must be observed, that, though it is sometimes a
painful period, the assuaging power of the bandages, the non-necessity
of confinement or abstinence from the usual diet, and
the perfect security every one feels as to the result, renders it
endurable. It is at the same time equally true, and worthy the
attention of any one about to undertake the cure, that during
the revivifying process, weakness and lassitude are the pregnant
attendants of the early part of it; and greatly disappointed
would be that new aspirant to health who should fancy that
all was <i>couleur de rose</i>. It is an old saying, and perhaps true,
that all good things cost money or trouble; and the attainment
of health, by the removal of long-standing complaints through
the water-cure, is no exception to the rule. It is a delusion to
suppose that inveterate diseases are to be cured by the water
treatment, as by miracle, without suffering. Moral energy and
firmness are necessary to go right through the ordeal. In such
circumstances the patient must exert all his fortitude to adhere
strictly to the instructions that are given to him.</p>


<h3>XXXI.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Dropsy.</span></h3>

<p>A frequent argument made use of against drinking water
is, that it produces dropsy. Now, if this were true, it must be
evident such a complaint ought not to exist amongst us&mdash;for<span class="pagenum" title="83"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83"></a></span>
whoever heard of an Englishman drinking too much water?
On the contrary, the English nation is remarkable for an almost
hydrophobic dislike to it.</p>

<p>The more the human body has been saturated with drugs,
alcohols, and other foreign matters, the greater is the necessity
for a free action of the pores and perspiration, because by these
agents it seeks to relieve itself of diseased matter. When the
skin is relaxed or incumbered by that oily exhalation which
is constantly exuding from the pores, and too often suffered
to remain on the surface, fluids collect beneath the skin and
cause inflammation&mdash;this is called dropsy.</p>

<p>One of the greatest promoters of dropsy, as every medical
man knows, is the lancet, by which the good blood is extracted
and a watery fluid substituted. Strong poisons of whatever
nature they may be, either mercury, blue pill, calomel, bark,
iodine, or any other of the ten thousand drugs from which
relief is sought, and for which alcohols or other stimulants are
persevered in, tend to vitiate the juices, and produce gout,
dropsy, and numberless complaints from which the habitual
water-drinker is exempt.</p>

<p>No modern writer on dropsy attributes it to drinking water,
nor, observes Dr. Johnson, is there anything in the physiology
of the capillary system of vessels which can warrant such an
opinion; on the contrary, <i>drinking largely of diluting liquids is
always recommended as an important part</i> of the cure of dropsy.
Dr. Gregory, author of the Theory and Practice of Medicine,
states that &ldquo;no diuretic medicines are likely to be of service,
without very copious dilution;&rdquo; and adds, &ldquo;<i>there cannot be a
greater error</i> than to imagine that dropsical accumulations may
be lessened by withholding liquid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>From the returns of 1841, within the city of London and bills
of mortality, amongst a people opposed to the use of cold
water in any way, we find that from dropsy alone the deaths
amounted to 584.</p>

<p>Is not this fact alone sufficient to carry conviction to our
minds, that dropsy is not the effect of water drinking? It may
be safely affirmed that those who never take physic and who
adhere to a water diet, will never be attacked with dropsy.</p>

<p>This complaint, except when of long standing, or under very
extraordinary circumstances, is generally curable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="84"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84"></a></span></p>


<h3>XXXII.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Smoking.</span></h3>

<p>&ldquo;Though smoking is decidedly prejudicial to health, it is not
so bad as drinking to excess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Smoking irritates the nerves and promotes the secretion of
saliva, which is withdrawn from digestion.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">5</a></p>

<p>&ldquo;By blunting the nerves, a man, as in drinking, may stand
a great deal of smoking without being visibly affected by it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A person who, previously to undergoing the water-cure,
could drink a gallon of fermented liquor, may, after it, be
affected by a single glass&mdash;from the fact of his nerves having
recovered their sensibility.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Persons who previously to the treatment were great smokers,
are frequently rendered ill by very little smoking after it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The nerves are strong and vigorous in proportion to their
sensibility and freshness.&mdash;He who goes through a thorough
water-cure treatment, gains a great moral as well as physical
command over himself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is generally the weak and debilitated who are the most
sensual and debauched.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The sound man has purer tastes, independent of his greater
self-command.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We find amongst the children of nature, amongst simple
peasants who have had but little contact with civilisation, the
purest virtue and truest feelings of honor.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Priessnitz.</span></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Observations.</span>&mdash;Persons who consider themselves in health,
will derive advantage by six weeks&rsquo; or two months&rsquo; treatment
at Gräfenberg, and will learn how to apply it to themselves
or families.</p>

<p>Parents will there acquire the habit of using cold water,
be prepared to ward off disease from themselves, and learn,
by simple means, how to preserve the health of their children.</p>

<p>Officers in the army, who have an insight into hydropathy,
will have nothing to fear from epidemics; they will find that<span class="pagenum" title="85"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85"></a></span>
fevers and inflammations are diseases which form the easiest
part of Mr. Priessnitz&rsquo; practice.</p>

<p>The water at Gräfenberg has no advantage over that which
we find everywhere, except that it is peculiarly cold and fresh.
In the general purposes of the cure, water should be soft, that
is to say, it must possess the quality of dissolving, and for this
reason it must be cold, and divested of all mineral properties;
for to prove its fitness, linen cloth washed in it must become
white, and vegetables dressed in it tender. Trout living in
water does not prove its softness, but frogs do; the softest
of all waters is the rain. Hard water makes the skin rough,
but soft water, on the contrary, renders it smooth. When
water, with the slightest acidity in it, has been suffered to
remain in leaden pipes, pumps or cisterns for any length of
time, it absorbs the dangerous qualities of the lead; and this
has been known to produce serious consequences. It is necessary,
therefore, that water should be drawn off before any is
drunk.</p>

<p>Those who wish to begin ablutions in winter, should do so
in a warm room, and as a beginning, instead of washing, they
may wet a towel, and with it be well rubbed all over twice a
day, or use the rubbing-sheet. The morning immediately on
getting out of bed, is the best time for the first ablution; the other
should be undertaken two or three hours after eating, <i>never</i> on
a full stomach, nor immediately after making any great exertion.
The rubbing should be continued from three to five
minutes.</p>

<p>It is conceived that one ablution a-day, and the drinking
of cold water, will enable those who are in health, and in the enjoyment
of life, to continue in that state. After any excess,
instead of resorting to drugs, the rubbing sheet should be resorted
to, and an increase in cold water as a beverage. The
same means may be resorted to by persons who have any reason
to suppose that they have caught cold.</p>

<p>In answer to the question, whether there is not some risk of
catching cold whilst washing, we answer, &ldquo;Not the least.&rdquo;
There is no better way of guarding against colds, or of hardening
the skin, to contend with atmospheric changes. But in
cold weather it is as well that all the body should be wetted
simultaneously. Even in cold weather the temperature of the
room to which the body is exposed, is higher or warmer than<span class="pagenum" title="86"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86"></a></span>
the water used, which cannot, in consequence, produce a cold.
The contrary remark may be applied to warm water, as we
have all experienced on getting out of a warm bath even in
summer. A Russian lady of the author&rsquo;s acquaintance took a
<i>warm</i> bath immediately after dinner, the result was, a want of
reaction, and a complete paralysation of the whole of one side
of the body.</p>

<p>Before entering cold water, we ought to wash the head and
the chest, in order to prevent the blood ascending to those
regions.</p>

<p>People, without knowing whether hot or mineral waters
will be beneficial or otherwise, make use of them because it is
the fashion so to do, or because their application is agreeable.
A little reflection would show them that there will not be a
wholesome reaction; that taken inwardly they must necessarily
injure or destroy the coats of the stomach; and when applied
outwardly, weaken the skin, thereby rendering the body susceptible
to every change of weather.</p>

<p>Those who resort to sea-bathing in general pay little or no
attention to diet. To derive advantage from a trip to any of
our watering places, the latter, for the time at least, should be
attended to.</p>

<p>The fact that the action of the human heart is repeated at
least one hundred thousand times a-day, with sufficient force
to keep in continual movement a mass of from 50 to 60 lbs. of
blood, might lead to the inquiry what watch, what machinery
could be more easily deranged? Can we wonder at men being
ill who are constantly eating too much, who indulge in acid
wines, in thick and adulterated beer, or spirituous liquors, or
hot liquids of whatsoever nature they may be?</p>

<p>Few of us sufficiently appreciate pure cold water. What
will not man submit to rather than adopt such means of cure&mdash;adapt
himself to such self-denial? What pain will he not
endure; what poisons swallow or rub into his flesh, rather than
consent to seek relief from such a humble source?</p>

<p>Animals, when thirsty, repair to the brook to quench their
thirst; when wounded, to assuage the pain. Water is nature&rsquo;s
medicine and man despises it.</p>

<p>What organic matter can grow or live without water? We
know that animals or plants excluded from its influence die.
Observe the vivifying effects of water upon vegetation after a<span class="pagenum" title="87"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87"></a></span>
shower. Then what shall be said to vain, short-sighted man,
who sets nature&rsquo;s laws at defiance, by avoiding what they enjoin,
and indulging in what they interdict? Why should he live
without water more than all else that has life? It may be
answered &ldquo;He does not live his time;&rdquo; for every day&rsquo;s experience
proves that more than half the inhabitants of the civilised
world are tormented by one disease or another, which
causes them to die before the natural term of life is completed.
This, evidently, was not the intention of Divine Providence,
since water, found every where, will prevent or cure disease,
enable human beings to attain a good old age, and die without
pain.</p>

<p>Stiffened joints, the dull eye, thickness of breathing, an
unnatural tendency to corpulency, wrinkles, baldness, bad
sight, and sallowness of complexion, are failings which clearly
indicate an habitual distaste for water. It cannot be doubted,
that in many of these cases, the mere drinking plentifully of
water, and washing the body once a day, would afford relief.
If they had always been accustomed to this they would not
have been thus affected.</p>

<p>What numbers of weakly, crippled children we see? &ldquo;Parents,
do you wash their bodies; do you encourage them in the
drinking of water? If not, you are instrumental to their
future misery: you deprive them of the power of being healthy
in life, or attaining to longevity.&rdquo; In looking around on the
organic world, we cannot but admire the perfection everything
seems to attain&mdash;the noblest work of creation an exception; we
exclaim, with Goldsmith, &ldquo;Man seems the only growth that
dwindles here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Health is the natural state of man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The causes of bodily disease, not proceeding from external
injury, are material, and consist of foreign matters introduced
into the system.</p>

<p>&ldquo;These foreign matters are divided into four parts:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I. Bodily substances which have not been eliminated in
proper time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<ins title="Transcriber's Note: items III and IV are not specified">II.</ins> Substances not assimilated, and notwithstanding which,
remain in the stomach, the skin, or the interior.
</p>

<p>&ldquo;Contagious ulcers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Corrupted elements; epidemical diseases.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Every acute disease is an attempt to dispel diseased matter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="88"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88"></a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Fever is not a disease, but the consequence of it; it is an
effect of an exertion greater than the power of the system.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The radical healing of acute diseases is only possible by
releasing the diseased matter, by means of water, an agent
which invariably effects its object, and that always in a manner
perceptible to the senses.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By means of physic and bleeding, acute diseases become
chronic; the system, medically treated, effects a partial, but
never a total ejection of diseased matter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As sooner or later a body must yield to the effects of
drugs, it is quite impossible that any one suffering from chronic
disease, unless healed by Hydropathy, should die a natural
death.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Chronic disease cannot be permanently cured by drugs:
Hydropathy alone will effect this, by changing the chronic
evil to acute eruptions, which are cured in the same way that
acute diseases are cured.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Men, like other organic beings, ought to live according to
nature&rsquo;s law, without pain, and die a natural death, that is to
say, without illness or suffering. But with us almost every
body dies prematurely, from the effects of poisoning in some
way or other.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Arbuthnot.</span></p>

<p>It was stated to Priessnitz, that in a case of gout, the bowels
of the patient by the treatment, had become constipated, to
which he replied, &ldquo;Cold water never produces torpor of the
bowels, but on the contrary, it excites.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the cure of disease, that which is most agreeable is not
always the best. That which lowers the system, generally
soothes and allays pain; bleeding, drugs, opium, and warm
baths do this, but they may fix the disease firmer in the system,
they diminish the energy so necessary to eradicate the disease.
Thus Gout, Piles, and many other complaints, are never
thoroughly cured by the faculty; they cannot abate the symptoms
without lowering the system.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To promote a crisis, dress lightly; warm clothing relaxes
the skin. The stronger and harder the skin, the better will a
crisis be developed. Every sore and boil cannot be considered
a crisis, some degenerate into disease, and have an inward
tendency. In a proper crisis of boils, they rise, burst, and heal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For itching rash in the arm, do not wear the bandage,
unless great pain ensues, and in that case only at night.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="89"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89"></a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Chopping or sawing wood is better exercise for the stomach
and bowels than walking.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To a lady who complained of want of sleep, and much pain
from an eruption on her body, Priessnitz said &ldquo;Take a tepid
bath for some days, eat lean meat without salt, and indulge
freely in butter, you will get well as soon as the rash has expended
itself: there can be no repose for the nerves until the
humours that fret them are expelled.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nervous temperaments are the strongest, but most irritable
when excited by acid humours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fingers being white after cold bathing denote weak
nerves; the fingers having lost their vitality, the blood ceases
to circulate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Constipation and relaxation of the bowels proceed from
the same causes, weakness and impurities; hydropathy corrects
both.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is impossible to warm, for any length of time, by hot
viands and warm water, their constant application only chills
the more; by relaxing and dilating they produce the opposite
effects to those which are so essential to health, namely Contraction.
Cold water determines the Caloric currents outwards
from the vital centre, and promotes decomposition.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot understand how drugs can reach any destined
point; it appears to me that all drugs are inimical to the human
subject.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Medicine introduced into the system, like the venom of a
serpent, permeates all the tissues.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mercury becomes enveloped in phlegm or slime, and remains
in the system, notwithstanding the body is continually subjected
to the laws of renovation and decay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Powerful medicines act speedily and detrimentally to the
constitution. The Water-cure is slow but advantageous in its
operations.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;The wet sheet, which is in fact, a poultice, extracts pernicious
matters, as a sponge water from a basin, and brings
something away each time it is immersed in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="90"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90"></a></span></p>

<h3>XXXIII.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Questions put to Mr. Priessnitz, and his
Answers.</span></h3>

<p>1.&mdash;Q. What should be done for:&mdash;</p>

<p>Severe cold settled on the lungs, attended with cough and
expectoration?</p>

<p>A. Rub the chest and throat with cold water, and hold water
in the mouth often. In cold climates, bandage the throat: in
warm climates, washing it often is best.</p>

<p>2.&mdash;Q. Inflammation and soreness of throat attended with
hoarseness and difficulty in speaking?</p>

<p>A. As No. 1.</p>

<p>3.&mdash;Q. Exposure to change of climate with clothes occasionally
wet, attended with shivering?</p>

<p>A. Rubbing-sheets.</p>

<p>4.&mdash;Q. Continual public speaking of damp evenings?</p>

<p>A. Rubbing-sheets. Wash head well. A foot-bath for a
long time; and take exercise afterwards until feet are warm.</p>

<p>5.&mdash;Q. Cold accompanied by fever and restlessness at night?</p>

<p>A. As No. 4.</p>

<p>6.&mdash;Q. Head-ache occasioned by excitement?</p>

<p>A. As No. 4.</p>

<p>7.&mdash;Q. Shooting pain and tightness across the chest?</p>

<p>A. As No. 4, and rub the chest well with wet hand.</p>

<p>8.&mdash;Q. How guard against the effects of a damp atmosphere?</p>

<p>A. Keep the throat and chest always bare; if kept close and
warm they will soon become relaxed. Parts most used should
be exposed to the air.</p>

<p>9.&mdash;Q. At present I am packed for half an hour, and
take the plunge bath at 5 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> Douche for three minutes at
12. Two Abreibungs and a Sitz-bath for half an hour at 5
<span class="smcap">p.m.</span> If I remain the summer, should I continue or diminish
this cure?</p>

<p>A. Continue it certainly for a month, and then begin to
diminish it, leaving off the Douche for instance.</p>

<p>10.&mdash;Q. If continued, might I take the Douche after my
walk in the morning before breakfast, and the Abreibungs at
mid-day, so as to have my afternoons free?</p>

<p>A. Some cure must be taken after dinner as a rule; but in
case of necessity the cure may be shirked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="91"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91"></a></span></p>

<p>11.&mdash;Q. Ought I to continue any part of the treatment on
leaving Gräfenberg, and what?</p>

<p>A. Washing morning and evening, either bath or Abreibung.</p>

<p>12.&mdash;Q. After leaving must I attend to the same diet, and
abstain entirely from Wine, Coffee, and Tea? or may I indulge
in them continuously in small quantities, or only occasionally?</p>

<p>A. Wine, Coffee and Tea may be taken now and then, but
by no means regularly.</p>

<p>13.&mdash;Q. On any return of my old complaints, blistered mouth,
indigestion, restlessness, uneasy sensations in the back and side,
what portion of the cure should I have recourse to?</p>

<p>A. The old complaints ought not to return, and will not if
the cure is carried through the summer; on the appearance of
any of them, they must be treated the same as they were here.</p>

<p>14.&mdash;Q. The sensations mentioned before now return
sometimes; but vanish after a few days&rsquo; severe treatment. It is
only since the last month that my limbs and muscles have
appeared to recover their tone and firmness, and enlarge.</p>

<p>A. Both of these observations speak volumes for the continuance
of the cure, as one cannot do too much: but one may
easily do too little; and it would be highly advisable to keep
on cleansing and strengthening every possible way.</p>

<p>15.&mdash;Q. Should I continue any of the treatment for the
child?</p>

<p>A. Bathe the child every morning and evening, that is, cold
washing, by means of bath or Abreibungs.</p>

<p>16.&mdash;Q. Might I myself treat her in the cases of measles and
scarlatina, and how?</p>

<p>A. In case of slight fever, a rubbing-sheet and Umschlag;
but it is impossible to prescribe beforehand how these diseases
are to be treated, as one cannot know how the child may be
affected. If the fever is severe, more wet sheets or rubbing-sheets
must be used than if it is slight. The criterion of
treatment is the degree of fever.</p>

<h2>TREATMENT AND CASES.</h2>

<h3>XXXIV.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Gout.</span></h3>


<p>Great difference of opinion exists as to the cause of gout.
Ancient physicians called it the daughter of Bacchus and Venus;
and truly persons, or their progeny, devoted to these two
divinities, offer the greatest number of examples.</p>

<p>To cure this complaint, the ingenuity of thousands of scientific
men has been taxed, and the whole pharmacop&oelig;ia applied
to in vain. Perspiration is mostly resorted to; but as this is
effected by warm baths, vapour baths, or drugs, the consequences
are so debilitating that few constitutions can bear them.
The result of all medical treatment in this disease is, the
degradation of robust constitutions, and the promotion of diseases
worse than the gout itself.</p>

<p>Volumes might be written on the various remedial measures
which have been resorted to in this complaint, and of which
time has shewn the fallacy. We now ask the invalid, if he
ever knew the gout radically cured by any pharmaceutical
means? Were Hydropathists asked whether they ever knew
cases of gout cured by water, they would unhesitatingly answer
in the affirmative. Incipient gout is always curable.
The same may be said of chronic gout, except in isolated cases:
then Hydropathy invariably gives relief; and by regulating the
functions of the body, improves the general health.</p>

<p>The following treatment and cases will shew how the manipulation
is varied, to combat this disease in its manifold forms:&mdash;</p>

<p class="mt15em">Gout cannot be cured by local applications; the whole
system must be purified by a general treatment, or no permanent
cure can be effected.</p>

<p>For occasional attacks of gout in the extremities, the constitution
being otherwise robust:&mdash;</p>

<p>In the morning, put a bandage on the part affected, pack the
patient in blankets (sweating process) until perspiration appears
in the face.</p>

<p>Then put him into the half-bath&mdash;water 62° to 65° Fahr.;
let him be well rubbed in this from 5 to 25 minutes, or until
friction can be applied to all parts alike. Cold water should be<span class="pagenum" title="93"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93"></a></span>
occasionally poured over head and shoulders during the operation.
This ended, put bandages round the waist and on the
afflicted part.</p>

<p>For the second treatment:&mdash;About mid-day, rubbed in a
packing-sheet; take a sitz-bath for fifteen minutes&mdash;first time
tepid 64°, afterwards cold; then put the offending member into
cold water for ten or fifteen minutes, and renew bandages.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, at 5 o&rsquo;clock, repeat mid-day treatment.
During the day, drink ten to fourteen tumblers of water.</p>

<p>The above treatment will generally put an end to a slight
attack of gout; but to eradicate it from the system, the cure
must be followed up. To effect this, for the sweating process
on the second day, substitute the packing-sheet until warm,
which generally requires the patient to lie in it from thirty
minutes to an hour.</p>

<p>Where a bath cannot be obtained, the rubbing sheet is used
instead; this should be very little wrung out, and if one does
not cool the body, a second or a third should be applied.</p>

<p>The douche is often applied in gout; but as that cannot be
the case in ordinary practice, the practitioner must use his
discretion in prescribing it.</p>

<p>It is good treatment to use the sweating process in the
morning, and the packing-sheet in the afternoon.</p>

<p>The bandages must be worn day and night, and changed
often.</p>

<p class="mt15em"><i>Cases.</i>&mdash;A patient, fifty years of age, with rheumatic gout,
bad digestion, nervousness, fingers blue and swollen, slight pain
in the knee, much debilitated, was ordered:&mdash;In the morning,
five rubbing sheets, two or three minutes each, allowing a short
interim between each. At noon, the same. At five o&rsquo;clock,
the same. Ten tumblers of water daily. Bandages to parts
affected, and round the loins always. On the patient experiencing
great pain under the knees, the morning treatment
was changed to lying in packing-sheets until well warmed,
followed by the tepid bath. Patient soon improved in health.</p>


<p class="mt15em">A&mdash;&mdash;, forty-six years of age, suffered fifteen years from
periodical attacks of gout, and had his last severe attack
in his feet, hands, and elbows, accompanied by paralysis,
which affected his voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="94"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94"></a></span></p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i>&mdash;Laid in packing-sheet until perspiration ensued
(two or three hours); then tepid bath renewed by cold water
being thrown over head and shoulders; noon, rubbing-sheet,
followed by sitz-bath 62° for fifteen minutes; cold foot-bath
fifteen minutes, and head-bath ten minutes; afternoon, morning
treatment repeated.</p>

<p>Alternate days, sweating in blankets instead of the sheets;
all other treatment the same as before.</p>

<p>This continued treatment was persevered in for ten weeks,
when patient was prescribed sweating in the morning, and
packing-sheet in the afternoon, followed by cold bath. Sitz
and foot-baths as before; head-bath discontinued. Shortly
after, sweating twice a day, with foot-baths, fifteen minutes
in the middle of the day. Sitz-baths dispensed with. This
treatment at the end of six weeks was again changed for perspiring
only once a day, for three hours. Patient was at length
ordered to discontinue the treatment altogether, and proceed
to the sea-side for a month. Soon after his return again to
Gräfenberg, he was able to walk fifteen miles at a time, as is
seen by his own letter.</p>


<p class="mt15em">B&mdash;&mdash;, fifty-six years of age, suffering from Gout upwards of
seventeen years, generally incapacitated from following his
occupation seven or eight months in a year. Feet and hands
distorted.</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i>&mdash;Packing sheet and tepid-bath in morning and
afternoon, and sitz and foot-bath, each fifteen minutes; at noon,
bandages round the waist. After a week&rsquo;s treatment, a fit
of gout came on in foot and ankle, which was combated by
packing-sheet and tepid bath before breakfast; tepid sitz-bath
at noon, and the morning treatment repeated in the afternoon.
After three days, a boil began to form under the left
jaw; treatment continued, with the exception of patient&rsquo;s going
(<i>after the packing-sheet</i>), into tepid bath for two minutes, then
into the cold bath for two minutes, and back to the tepid,
from ten to fifteen minutes.</p>

<p>In eight days, gout returned with greater violence, when
recourse was had to the packing-sheet, as before; with tepid
baths from twenty minutes to an hour, besides following
up other parts of the treatment. In seven or eight days the
fit quite subsided. Some time after this he had a relapse,<span class="pagenum" title="95"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95"></a></span>
which patient stated to me, under the allopathic treatment,
would have confined him to his room at least six months;
this was treated as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Packing-sheet until warm, followed by tepid bath, ten
minutes; then walked about the room for a quarter of an hour;
then the bath again for a quarter of an hour, a respite of a
few minutes, and the bath a third time.</p>

<p>Two hours after the above operation, a tepid sitting-bath
62°, for twenty minutes.</p>

<p>In the afternoon the packing-sheet and bath as before. This
treatment was repeated, every day for six days, when patient
was out of doors again.</p>

<p>From this time patient felt himself so changed a man, that
the author saw him cry with joy. He could use his limbs as
he had not done for many years, and to prove it, ran up a hill
with astonishing alacrity. Three days treatment were sufficient
to reduce the swelling of his knuckles, toes, and hands.</p>

<p>This patient, on his first arrival, Mr. Priessnitz ordered, without
any previous preparation, into a tepid bath, where he was
rubbed upwards of an hour.</p>


<p class="mt15em">C&mdash;&mdash;, aged forty. Gout generally returned in summer.</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i>&mdash;Morning, and afternoon, packing-sheet, tepid
bath; noon, douche, three minutes.</p>

<p>After six weeks treatment, strong redness and much pain to
the conjunctiva; douche omitted.</p>

<p>Sitz-baths of from an hour to an hour and a half; foot-baths;
cold wet bandages to the eye, which became effected.</p>

<p>Then sweating processes, with wet bandages to the head,
which afforded relief.</p>

<p>Alternate tepid, cold and tepid baths for a quarter of an
hour; immediately after the packing-sheet, foot-bath and water
poured over the ancle. Eyes still red; foot-bath resorted to
three times a day, followed by rubbing sheet, instead of
the bath and bandage to the eye. Eyes could bear the
light. Patient&rsquo;s appetite good and sleep sound. At night
his arms, head, and most of his body were covered with
bandages.</p>

<p>In three weeks, patient&rsquo;s whole body covered with an
eruption; recourse again had to the packing-sheet and tepid
bath twice a day. From this time health improved daily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="96"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96"></a></span></p>

<p class="mt15em">D&mdash;&mdash;, a gouty subject, forty-five years of age. Priessnitz,
called up in the middle of the night, found the Baron labouring
under an attack of gout in his chest and stomach, which almost
prevented his breathing. He was immediately put into
a packing-sheet for from five to ten minutes, and out of that
into a tepid bath, where two men rubbed him for a quarter of
an hour; cold water being continually thrown over his head
and shoulders; this effectually put an end to the attack, and
the patient afterwards slept soundly until the time for his usual
treatment next morning. This case shows that the fear of this
treatment driving gout to the stomach, is groundless and it
combats a dangerous attack, and quicker than it can be done
by any other means.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Hereditary Gout.</i>&mdash;E&mdash;&mdash;, a Polish nobleman, fifty-four
years of age, suffered two winters from hereditary gout, which
had existed in his family for upwards of forty years.</p>

<p>He was attacked in his feet and arms, which confined him
to his bed several months.</p>

<p><i>Treatment:</i>&mdash;In the mornings, packing-sheet and tepid bath;
noon, rubbing-sheet followed by sitz-bath, fifteen minutes;
afternoon, rubbing-sheet.</p>

<p>In eighteen days he had boils on his feet and arms, from
which matter continued to exude for three or four weeks; at
the expiration of which Priessnitz said, &ldquo;Now we will increase
the treatment, to see if any more bad matter remains in the
system.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sweating process and cold bath were now resorted to
three or four times a week; the packing-sheet and cold bath
other days; and the douche every day for three minutes.
This treatment was continued for several weeks, during which
no change of any kind was produced, a confirmation of the
cure being effected.</p>

<p>On leaving Gräfenberg, Priessnitz advised him to return the
next year, to see if the cure was a radical one.</p>

<p>In 1845, the Count returned, when he was subjected to a
most vigorous treatment, such as sweating, douche, etc., for a
month, without any return of gout.</p>

<p>On leaving Gräfenberg he assured me, that he was not
only cured of gout; but that his digestive powers, which for<span class="pagenum" title="97"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97"></a></span>
years had been deranged, were in perfect order, and that his
general health was completely restored.</p>

<p>Sixteen years previous to the Count&rsquo;s going to Gräfenberg,
he had his elbow wounded by a ball in a duel, which
occasionally caused him great pain. For the cure of this,
he, at the time, rubbed in a yellow ointment. Singular
to say, after a lapse of sixteen years, during a crisis, this
ointment re-appeared on the elbow and arm, so thick as to
be taken off with the finger. The exuding of this ointment
lasted about eight days. Since the cure of his gout was
effected, the arm has been pliant, and the elbow has been
free from pain.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Gout in Head and Feet.</i>&mdash;F&mdash;&mdash;, a German professor, aged
sixty; a small delicate man, with gout in both hands and both
feet: all were contracted, he had been a martyr to gout for
years and upwards, when a paroxysm of gout came on the
following morning.</p>

<p>The following treatment was resorted to. Morning, packing-sheet
until thoroughly warm; then tepid bath 64° for two
hours, during which time 200 cans of cold water were thrown
over his head and shoulders.</p>

<p>Twenty-five cans were first thrown; then great friction for
some time; then twenty-five cans more, followed by friction;
and so repeated until two hundred cans had been thrown over
him.</p>

<p>Heating bandages were applied to all parts afflicted, and
kept there day and night.</p>

<p>The above treatment was resorted to again in the afternoon.</p>

<p>One paroxysm that I witnessed, lasted three weeks. It was
astonishing to see the courage displayed by this patient.</p>

<p>Each operation afforded relief for the time; but the enemy
had strong hold upon the system, and was ejected with difficulty.</p>

<p>During all the time the patient had a good appetite and
slept soundly at night.</p>

<p>He was still under the cure when I left Gräfenberg. Priessnitz
said, to effect this cure, it would require at least four years&rsquo;
treatment, which the patient said he would prefer to a renewal
of the suffering he had already undergone, previously to
coming to Gräfenberg.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="98"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98"></a></span></p>

<p class="mt15em"><i>Calcareous Deposit in the Knees, and high state of Inflammation.</i>&mdash;The
last case shews how the human body may be
exposed to the action of water, with friction, for any length of
time. The present case is that of an English Gentleman, well
known to all visitors at Gräfenberg.</p>

<p class="mt15em">G&mdash;&mdash;, aged between 50 and 60, gouty for the last twenty
years, with contraction of the limbs, chalk stones having
formed in the joints. This patient travelled from Italy to
Gräfenberg during the heat of summer, and, on arriving, had
a most painful attack of gout in his lower extremities.</p>

<p>Priessnitz, without the least preparation, put him into a
tepid bath, and he was rubbed by three men for nearly three
hours, occasionally throwing pails of cold water over his head
and shoulders. This so reduced the inflammation, that,
towards the end of that period, the afflicted part might also
be rubbed with the wet hand.</p>

<p>Heating bandages were then applied to those parts and the
waist.</p>

<p>Water was drunk plentifully during and after the operation.</p>

<p>Patient was able afterwards to get out of doors with the
use of sticks, and slept well at night.</p>

<p>Next morning he began the regular treatment, which was
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Packing-sheet until warm; then the bath as before for about
two hours; noon, rubbing-sheet and sitz-bath, fifteen minutes;
afternoon, morning process renewed.</p>

<p>Mr. Priessnitz told this patient that, by the following means,
he might always ward off a violent attack of gout:&mdash;</p>

<p>On feeling the slightest sensation of gout, he should instantly
be put into a tepid bath, 62 deg., replenished with cold water,
and be therein rubbed for a couple of hours.</p>

<p>This gentleman&rsquo;s general health is perfect: he very seldom
has any attacks, and they are slight; but the calcareous deposit
in his knees, up to the present, resists all attempts at
removal.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Acute attack of Gout.</i>&mdash;A patient being attacked with gout
was put into a tepid bath, 68 deg., up to the neck, and rubbed
by himself and two men. By particular injunctions, the process
was not to be discontinued until all pain subsided. The
original temperature of the bath was maintained by fresh sup<span class="pagenum" title="99"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99"></a></span>plies
of cold water. In seven hours the patient was completely
relieved. His after-treatment was:&mdash;</p>

<p>Morning, packing-sheet and plunge-bath, bandage round
the waist and on part afflicted; at noon, douche, and afterwards
a rubbing-sheet; afternoon, rubbing-sheet; the simplest
food. On a return of the acute attack, patient was ordered
to perform the bath operation again; but, not persevering
in remaining seven hours in the bath, the attack was not
overcome: the patient was then ordered cold bath every
morning before breakfast (temperature kept always as cold as
possible), from fifteen to twenty minutes, which effected the
cure. This patient was allowed a little weak chocolate, and
was ordered to drink abundantly of water.</p>


<p class="mt15em">A&mdash;&mdash; had a most violent attack at Gräfenberg, for which
he was put up to his neck into a tepid bath, 64 deg., and there
rubbed by two men for <i>seven</i> hours. Priessnitz gave particular
orders that the patient should not leave the bath until all pain
had completely subsided. Cold water was frequently added, to
keep that in the bath at the original temperature. By these
means the attack was completely subdued. Daily treatment:&mdash;</p>

<p>Morning, packing-sheet and cold plunge-bath; bandage to
be applied to parts affected; noon, douche, and sitz-bath, fifteen
minutes; afternoon, as in the morning.</p>

<p>Instructions:&mdash;Eat plain food; and in case of a return of
gout, faithfully perform the first operation.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Gout in the Foot and Ankle.</i>&mdash;A lady awoke in the morning
with pain in her foot and ankle, which were both swollen.</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i>&mdash;Packing-sheet for an hour, followed by a rubbing-sheet;
after which a foot-bath, up to the instep, for a
quarter of an hour; and the foot and leg, up to the knee, well
rubbed all the time.</p>

<p>Bandages were then applied from the toes to the knee.</p>

<p>At noon, and in the afternoon, the foot-bath was again applied,
and the bandages were changed.</p>

<p>This simple treatment put an end to the attack in two days.
If it had not done so, it ought to have been repeated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="100"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100"></a></span></p>


<h3>XXXV.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Rheumatism, etc.</span></h3>

<p>Gout, rheumatism, sciatica, lumbago, tic doloureux, and
neuralgia, all being attended with inflammation, are so nearly
allied, that the same treatment as for gout, with slight variation,
might be applied to any or all of them.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Rheumatism.</i>&mdash;On a slight attack of rheumatism, rub the
part affected with wet hands three times a day, from a quarter
of an hour to an hour each time; then apply a bandage, which
change when dry, and wear it until the pain ceases.</p>

<p>Rub the body all over with a wet towel, then a dry one;
wait five minutes, then repeat the same operation four times in
succession: this will animate the circulation. Then apply a
bandage as in the case of gout. This treatment should be applied
several times a day. Rheumatic subjects ought never to
be overclothed, wear flannel, or fail drinking water.</p>

<p>When the attack is more severe, three rubbing-sheets in
succession, allowing an interim of from three to five minutes
between each. The body must be dried after each rubbing-sheet;
this increases the effect of the next rubbing-sheet.
Rub the parts affected often with wet hands, and apply
bandages. This treatment may be repeated three or four
times a day. If there is a great want of circulation, the
patient may lie in bed until warm, between the application of
each rubbing-sheet.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Neuralgic Pains.</i>&mdash;Whatever the nature of these pains may
be (supposing the patient not too debilitated), perspiration will
generally be found to relieve them. To effect this:&mdash;</p>

<p>When in bed in the morning, add a number of blankets,
and on them a feather-bed: there remain until in a profuse
perspiration; then cool the body, either by rubbing-sheets, a
cold bath,&mdash;or get a washing-tub, stand up in it, and have
some jugs of water poured over the head and shoulders. This
very often settles the affair at once.</p>

<p>A patient was afflicted in every joint so that he could not
be moved in bed without great pain.</p>

<p>Packing-sheets until warm, which required about half an<span class="pagenum" title="101"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101"></a></span>
hour, ten times a day, allowing an interval between them.
Each packing sheet was followed by a rubbing with wet
hands.</p>

<p>This treatment in one day enabled patient to stand; then
the packing sheets were used four times a day, followed by
rubbing sheets. Parts affected and loins always enclosed in
bandages. Patient drank sixteen to twenty glasses of water a
day. He was out of doors the third day, and afterwards pursued
a more vigorous treatment, such as sweating, douche, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="mt15em">A&mdash;&mdash;, had a severe rheumatic attack in both knees; he thought
swinging his legs backwards and forwards would relieve him;
instead of which, it brought on enlargement of the joints and
inflammation: whilst at Gräfenberg I inquired of Priessnitz
what he ought to have done.&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Answer</i>&mdash;He ought in, the first instance, to have rubbed the
knees well and often with wet hands and worn a bandage. If
this was not sufficient, then to have put the feet and legs, over
the knees into cold water for half an hour at least, rubbing
them all the time, and apply a bandage from the calf of the leg
to the middle of the thigh.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Chronic Rheumatism.</i>&mdash;A&mdash;&mdash;, contracted rheumatism in
1837, which commenced as sciatica. Constitution greatly debilitated.
Medical advice, sea baths, hot baths, and other remedies,
useless.</p>

<p>Patient went to Gräfenberg, August 1843, and left in May
following.</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i>&mdash;Packing-sheet, followed by cold bath twice
a-day; noon, sitz-bath and foot-bath, fifteen minutes each; legs
rubbed all the time up to the knee. Douche three minutes
daily.</p>

<p>In November, one of his usual attacks came on, when sixteen
rubbing sheets a-day were resorted to. Four of these were
given in succession four times a-day; between each rubbing
sheet, the patient being weak lay down in bed, until warm
bandages were applied as usual.</p>

<p>This attack subsided after the second day, when patient
renewed his former treatment.</p>


<p class="mt15em">B&mdash;&mdash;, travelling in North America, and exposed to severe<span class="pagenum" title="102"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102"></a></span>
rains without the means of changing his clothes, suffered the
consequences such circumstances frequently entail. Rheumatism
almost beyond endurance induced him to go to Gräfenberg.</p>

<p>At the first interview, Priessnitz put him first into a tepid
bath 64 deg., out of which he plunged into a cold bath, where
he staid about a minute, and from that he returned again to
the tepid, when bandages were applied to his waist and parts
affected.</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i>&mdash;Morning, packing-sheet until warm, then cold
bath; noon, rubbing-sheet; afternoon, packing-sheet, twenty
minutes, and then rubbing-sheet again.</p>

<p>Left Gräfenberg in a month, during which time patient used
the rubbing-sheet mornings and evenings; exposed his body
(after that in the morning) quite naked in his room, from a
quarter to half an hour.</p>

<p>On returning to Gräfenberg, the douche was substituted for
the rubbing-sheet at noon. After continuing the treatment
for some time, rheumatism returned, when he was ordered
three rubbing-sheets five minutes each, twice a-day; between
each an air bath of five minutes.</p>

<p>A crisis of boils ensued, and after they healed, patient was
perfectly well. The patient writes to a friend&mdash;&ldquo;I now leave
Gräfenberg with a clean body, and a sincere wish for your own
speedy cure, and that of all the agreeable acquaintances that I
leave behind me, under the safe care of our virtuous and sagacious
friend V. Priessnitz.&rdquo;</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Chronic Rheumatism, Chronic Headache, Constipation, Piles, &amp;c.</i>&mdash;A
Gentleman, aged about 45, was treated as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Morning, sweating process and cold bath, three minutes;
noon, douche, three minutes; an hour afterwards, sitz-bath fifteen
minutes; foot-bath fifteen minutes; head-bath ten minutes;
one following the other immediately; afternoon, noon treatment
over again; all night&mdash;loins, feet, legs, and thighs, to the
fork, were encased in bandages.</p>

<p>In a few months, rheumatism, piles, and constipation were
cured, but head-ache returned at intervals.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Rheumatic attack in the Back, Shoulders, and Neck.</i>&mdash;The
sweating process, followed by three rubbing-sheets not much
wrung out, applied without intermission for five minutes each,<span class="pagenum" title="103"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103"></a></span>
put an end to the attack at once. If this number of rubbing-sheets
had not cooled the body, more must have been used.</p>

<p>Had rheumatism continued, rubbing-sheets must have been
resorted to again in the afternoon, and the sweating resumed
the next day.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Rheumatic Fever.</i>&mdash;For a slight attack of rheumatic fever,
three rubbing-sheets three times a-day were found sufficient.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Rheumatic Gout.</i>&mdash;A gentleman named Heymann, about 34
years of age, at the fire at Hamburg was exposed to the wet
from the engines for several days and nights. The result was,
a violent attack of rheumatic gout; first in the knees and feet,
then neck and arms; afterward in hip and both breasts, which
confined him to bed a whole year, from April 1843 to April
1844. During this time he took large quantities of medicine,
and used steam and sulphur baths: about seventy of the former,
and near a hundred of the latter. Also mud and sulphur baths,
which enabled him to walk for about a month, when he was
again confined to bed. Gout having attacked the breast, both
his medical attendants declared they could do no more. 1st
May, 1844, he was conveyed to Gräfenberg, so crippled that
he could not dress himself. He began the treatment as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Morning, packing-sheet and tepid bath; noon, three rubbing-sheets,
at intervals of five minutes, with open windows; afternoon,
packing-sheet one hour, and tepid bath; bandage round
the body, and from ankles to knees during the night.</p>

<p>Pain increasing, parts affected were rubbed with wet hands
both day and night until they became hot. Body entirely
bandaged by night. Bandage changed three or four times
as pain resulted from the bandages being dry.</p>

<p>At the expiration of three months, patient enabled to walk
out. Treatment changed.</p>

<p>Morning, packing-sheet and tepid bath; noon, one rubbing-sheet,
followed by sitz-bath for quarter of an hour; douche
before and after breakfast for three minutes; then morning and
evening packing-sheet and bath; tepid for two minutes; then
cold one minute and back to tepid bath for two minutes, instead
of an entire tepid bath.</p>

<p>Two months&rsquo; continuation of this treatment brought out<span class="pagenum" title="104"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104"></a></span>
an eruption around the body, and on the calves of the legs;
also a strong fever which lasted nine days, which was succeeded
by boils.</p>

<p>Then three packing-sheet a-day were applied, and tepid, cold,
and tepid baths; continually changing from one to another for
an hour and a half. Douche and rubbing-sheet stopped during
the fever.</p>

<p>The eruption continued for three months, discharging
whitish brown matter. During all this time the last treatment
was persevered in.</p>

<p>The eruption and boils gave great relief. When pain was
diminished and the eruption ceased, the body bandage was
relinquished and those of the waist and calves retained, and
cold bath for one minute, succeeded the packing sheet.</p>

<p>1st April, 1845. Douche, from three to five minutes, substituted
for the rubbing-sheet.</p>

<p>May 16th, 1845.&mdash;Patient was declared perfectly well. He
had gone the whole of the winter without stockings, neckcloth,
or waistcoat, wearing only linen coat and trousers, and sleeping
with his windows wide open. When I saw him at Gräfenberg,
in May, I thought I never saw a man in such robust
rude health in my life.</p>

<p>This case made a great sensation at Hamburg, as the party is
well known on the exchange of that city.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Sciatica.</i>&mdash;A soldier aged 35, after having been three months
in the hospital with Sciatica, without relief, was cured in five
days by the following treatment:&mdash;</p>

<p>In the morning sweating process and cold bath; noon, two
rubbing-sheets; afternoon, the same; much rubbing at other
times with wet hands. Bandages to the part were applied, and
much water drank.</p>

<p>This case was treated by the author at Limerick; and the
following process was adopted:&mdash;</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Sciatica and Lumbago.</i>&mdash;Patient ordered:&mdash;Morning, four
rubbing-sheets; at noon, the same; afternoon the same, and
if necessary, to be repeated on going to bed. The usual
interval of time between each sheet to be observed, and parts
affected covered in bandages. The treatment to have been
repeated next day, had not the first removed the pains.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="105"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105"></a></span></p>

<p>In all cases of this nature, Rubbing with wet hands is highly
beneficial, and sometimes Enemas of cold water should be
resorted to. If obstinate, the sweating process must be
employed. I knew a very severe acute case of Sciatica and
Lumbago relieved in two days, by the application of four
rubbing-sheets at four intervals during the day, and the
evening bandages were applied, and water drunk in abundance.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Lumbago or Rick in the Back.</i>&mdash;A young man woke early in
the morning with a most excruciating pain in his loins. He
could not determine whether it was simply Lumbago, or a Rick
in the back, brought on from playing at skittles or chopping
wood the day before.</p>

<p>Priessnitz had him turned on his stomach, his back rubbed
for an hour with wet hands, and then covered with a bandage.</p>

<p>The Rubbing was to be repeated every four hours, and the
bandage changed every two hours.</p>

<p>The patient was to remain lying on his stomach the whole
day and night if not cured. The reason for this must be evident
to those who reflect upon it. Cured the same day.</p>

<p>Violent attack of Lumbago, supposed to have been brought
on by using the dumb-bells; the party being unaccustomed to
their use.</p>

<p>Patient had rubbing with wet hands, and wearing a bandage
for two days, when he could hardly rise from a chair; then he
commenced the following treatment:&mdash;</p>

<p>Saturday.&mdash;Morning, packing-sheet for an hour, followed by
three rubbing-sheets; noon, two rubbing-sheets and an Enema;
night, a rubbing-sheet. This was not renewed at night,
as patient&rsquo;s extremities were cold and prevented his sleeping.</p>

<p>Sunday.&mdash;Four rubbing-sheets; after this operation, the
improvement was almost miraculous. Patient took a long walk.</p>

<p>Monday.&mdash;Treatment as yesterday; could turn in bed with
less difficulty.</p>

<p>Tuesday.&mdash;Packing-sheet forty minutes, preceded by a
tepid-bath sixteen minutes, with great friction; noon, four
rubbing-sheets; evening, loins rubbed with wet hands for
half-an-hour.</p>

<p>Wednesday.&mdash;Slept well and could turn with ease in bed;
three rubbing-sheets and friction thrice during the day with
wet hands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="106"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106"></a></span></p>

<p>Drank fourteen tumblers of water daily, and wore a bandage
night and day.</p>

<p>Thursday.&mdash;Perfectly well. By the means here described,
patient&rsquo;s bowels were kept in order; his tongue always clean.
Had his treatment failed, the sweating process must have been
resorted to.</p>


<h3>XXXVI.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Tic-Doloureux.</span></h3>

<p>This is another of those complaints that baffle medical skill,
and upon which medical men are at issue as to the cause; some
alleging it to be a derangement of the nervous system, others
think it is in the humours of the body, which contain an acrimony
irritating to the nerves.</p>

<p>The result of my observation is, that if under the Water
cure, it is not cured in three months, it is extremely doubtful if
it will succumb to that treatment. Dr. Munde doubted if purely
nervous Tic-doloureux was curable by any process; but speaks
more positively as to that which arises from acrimonious
humour. He says, &ldquo;I speak with a perfect knowledge of this
disease, having suffered for three years, and having made observations
upon several others who suffered severely from this
complaint. Eight months&rsquo; treatment cured me after trying all
other remedies in vain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I knew a patient who had laboured under Tic in his head for
fourteen or fifteen years, perfectly cured in three months. His
treatment was the same as for Rheumatism.</p>

<p>Another patient put a bandage to her face at night, whilst
under a paroxysm of Tic; this increased the pain, the reason of
which was, her not having prepared the system first. Next
day she underwent the sweating process, and could then wear
the bandage with great advantage.</p>

<p>A person, whom I knew, suffering from Tic in his legs, made
no progress because of the injudicious use of the Douche.
The Douche was abandoned, and the packing-sheet and tepid
bath twice a day substituted with great advantage.</p>

<p>Another <i>case of severe</i> Tic came under my notice, that
resisted all treatment. The paroxysm was only allayed by very
long tepid baths 62°, and great friction.</p>

<p class="mt15em"><i>Obstinate case of Tic in the Thigh.</i>&mdash;This case is given to<span class="pagenum" title="107"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107"></a></span>
shew the way in which Priessnitz meets extraordinary
circumstances.</p>

<p>H. from Berlin, aged 54, had a settled pain down one of his
thighs; he was treated for it seven years ago at Gräfenberg.
In a few months he thought himself cured. For seven years
he felt no inconvenience, and lived as he had formerly done.
At the expiration of that period, pain returned; not wishing to
devote so much time to the cure as he knew it would require at
Gräfenberg, he went to Carlsbad, where the pain became insupportable.
In this state he again had recourse to Priessnitz.
He has now been there four months, undergoing a vigorous
treatment of packing-sheets, baths, rubbing-sheets, and sitz-baths,
varied in an infinity of ways, without experiencing
much benefit; his sleep, which has been disturbed the last
eighteen months, still continues so.</p>

<p>Nearly all the sleep he obtains is in the packing-sheet. In
this he lies from his arm-pits down to his thighs, from 9 to
11 o&rsquo;clock at night, and again from 2 to 4 o&rsquo;clock in the
morning. At 6 o&rsquo;clock he commences his usual treatment.
The last fortnight before I left Gräfenberg, pain had ceased,
but his sleeping was as disturbed as usual.</p>


<h3>XXXVII.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Affection of the Throat and Pain at
the Chest.</span></h3>

<p>A delicate lady, aged twenty-five: morning, packing-sheet
until warm and tepid bath; noon, rubbing-sheet and sitz-bath;
afternoon, rubbing-sheet.</p>

<p>After a few days&rsquo; treatment, catamenia came on, notwithstanding
which, as patient experienced no inconvenience, the
treatment was continued as before. In two days, pain in the
abdomen and hips was felt. All the previous treatment was
now discontinued, and three rubbing-sheets a day were prescribed,
until pain ceased, when it was again resumed.</p>

<p>Throat, and pain at the chest, were cured in six weeks, and
patient had gained eight pounds in weight.</p>

<p>This lady thought she had an affection of the heart. Priessnitz
enquired if she felt pain there: she answered no. &ldquo;Then,&rdquo;
said he, &ldquo;the heart is sound.&rdquo; Three years ago, catamenia lasted
only five days, but latterly it extended to seven. Priessnitz
said, with her it ought only to last three or four days. This<span class="pagenum" title="108"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108"></a></span>
was effected. Her husband, who had occasional attacks of bile,
gained nine pounds in six weeks. I attended the weighing of
these parties, and can vouch for the fact.</p>


<h3>XXXVIII.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Fevers.</span></h3>

<p>Two Hundred Years Ago, Dr. Vanderheyden of Ghent wrote a
work in which he declared all fevers curable by cold water.
Dr. Sir John Floyer, fifty years later, wrote his work, and
then came Drs. Hahn, Smith and others, and finally, Dr.
Currie of Liverpool, who by their works supported the same
theory. It is true that though where medicine saved its
hundreds, their practice saved thousands, the <i>Modus Operandi</i>
was somewhat speculative. It was reserved until our
own time to witness the application of water reduced to
a science. Priessnitz by his packing-sheet has produced
the great desideratum, which renders his treatment omnipotent
over all febrile disorders; and if he had discovered
nothing else, this would hand his name down to the latest
posterity.</p>

<p>It is often asked what fevers are curable by the Hydropathic
processes. To this it may be answered, except where by age
or disease patients are not reduced to the last stage of existence,
<i>all</i> are curable. I made constant inquiries when at
Gräfenberg&mdash;witnessed the treatment of innumerable cases
of fever, amongst others Typhus and Brain Fever, and I
could not discover that Priessnitz during his long practice
had ever lost a patient.</p>

<p>I have frequently treated cases of fever and inflammation
myself with the most heartfelt satisfaction; as in every
instance on the application of the sheet or the bath, the
patient was relieved in the same manner that a plant
dying for the want of water, is resuscitated on being supplied
with it.</p>

<p>After the number of works published on this subject,
all protesting the safety of this mode of treatment, and the
total absence of danger, it may be fairly presumed, that the
packing-sheet process will ere long take the lead in medical
practice.</p>

<p>As almost all complaints trace their origin to fever
or inflammation, if these can be allayed on their first<span class="pagenum" title="109"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109"></a></span>
symptoms, a host of evils to the human family will be
avoided.</p>

<p>It does not require any great sagacity to perceive that when
the body is surcharged with heat, if enveloped in a damp sheet,
the sheet immediately becomes hot; take it away and you
remove with it a certain amount of heat. The oftener this is
repeated the more the calorie is diminished, and each sheet
requires more time to heat; continue changing the sheet, and
the body resumes a normal state. When once the heat is
eliminated the patient is cured of the Fever.</p>


<p class="mt15em">The following modes of treatment and cases will enable the
practitioner to judge how he should treat his patient as circumstances
may arise.</p>

<p>As general rules:&mdash;</p>

<p>In the cold fit, use rubbing-sheets well wrung out, with a
slight interim between each until the hot stage is produced.
In the hot stage packing-sheets should be changed as often as
necessary. In Typhus I have known them changed forty or
fifty times in a day. The bath which ought at first to be a little
tepid and cooled by degrees, should be resorted to at intervals
twice or thrice a day, from a quarter of an hour to an hour.
Should the heat action be prematurely violent, or likely to end
in inflammation, resort to a sitz-bath with or without a foot-bath,
instead of the tepid bath, particularly where either the
brain, organs of sense, or those within the thorax are at all
engaged.</p>

<p>Rubbing-sheets, in certain cases where the vital energies are
weak or languid, will be sufficient to suppress a febrile paroxysm.
Their renewal and time of application must entirely depend on
the age, strength and idiosyncrasy of the case: water should
be drunk in small quantities, and frequently.</p>

<p>Where the brain is attacked, water must be constantly
applied to that locality, so as not to allow of an increase of
temperature.</p>

<p>Where there is no want of bodily strength in the patient, the
quickest and surest method of putting an end at once to fever,
is as follows. Put him into a bath up to the shoulders, tepid
63° or 64° to begin with, and to be renewed constantly by
cold water being poured over the shoulders; two persons
rubbing the patient the whole time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="110"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110"></a></span></p>

<p>When he is quite fatigued, take him out, dry the body and
throw the window open for air; when recovered a little,
renew the operation, and so on for the third time if necessary.
Then dress and go out to walk. Drink plentifully of water.</p>

<p>If very cold on coming out of the bath, walk without the
body bandage, but put a large thick one from the hips to the
arm-pits on returning home. Let the patient rest two or three
hours; and if fever return repeat the foregoing treatment.</p>


<p class="mt15em">A Mr. B&mdash;&mdash;, who was greatly debilitated, had, for fever,
a tepid bath for half an hour to an hour and half; also many
rubbing-sheets; on one occasion as many as twenty-nine in a
day. If the fever resist the above treatment, then resort to
the packing-sheet.</p>


<p class="mt15em">Dr. L&mdash;&mdash;, for fever, ordered, five or six rubbing-sheets
in succession. Head bath for a quarter of an hour. Bandage
from hips to arm-pits, to be changed often, even in the night;
to be much in the open air.</p>

<p>In typhus fever, medical men do not make the distinction
between congestion of the venous and arterial systems. They
imagine that inflammatory action exists, whereas it is in typhus,
venous congestion: therefore, the leeching and severe depletory
measures are decidedly wrong; they increase the existing evil,
lower and exhaust the vital powers, and if persevered in, lead
to death, or a long lingering state of convalescence. On the
contrary, Hydropathy acts upon a diametrically opposite system:
by the imbibition of water, containing as it does an excess
of oxygen, the vital forces are sustained, the blood is decarbonised,
the appetite improved, the bowels regulated, etc. etc.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Fever.</i>&mdash;An English officer who caught a fever twenty years
ago in the West Indies, wrote to Priessnitz that all his prospects
in life were blighted, and that existence was almost
intolerable. He came to Gräfenberg and was treated as follows:</p>

<p>Early in the morning packing-sheet and bath; wore heating
bandage always. Breakfasted at eight o&rsquo;clock, when, from
nine o&rsquo;clock until five o&rsquo;clock in the evening, he was ordered
to change the waist bandage every ten minutes. At five
o&rsquo;clock packing-sheet and bath.</p>

<p>If ague appeared, which it did sometimes, then rubbing-<span class="pagenum" title="111"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111"></a></span>sheets,
well wrung out were applied with great friction until
the fit was over.</p>

<p>This patient was perfectly cured in three months.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Nervousness and slow Fever, and disposition to a Decline.</i>&mdash;A
lady was treated as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Morning, five packing-sheets and bath, 62°; noon, douche
and sitz-bath; afternoon, rubbing-sheet and two sitz-baths.</p>

<p>At first, she was ordered to have a cold bath prepared by the
bed-side at night, and when fever and sweating came on, to go
into the bath, and repeat it if necessary. She had a bad cough at
the time; her friends thought such a proceeding would end in
her death; the patient, however, recovered from her fever and
cough, and left much improved in health.</p>

<p class="mt15em">On awaking in the morning with distracting head-ache, parched
tongue, and all the concomitants of fever, a lady was put into
a packing-sheet; in twelve minutes, head-ache ceased. After
remaining enveloped an hour or two, rubbing-sheets were applied,
followed by a sitz-bath of twenty minutes: she drank
water freely. This one application effected a cure.</p>

<p class="mt15em">A young lady had her foot and ankle much swollen from
rheumatic gout. Second day, arose with head-ache and pain in all
her limbs; and towards evening, had a slight fever. For this,
she was put into a tepid bath 62°, and rubbed for forty minutes,
when the arm-pits feeling no warmer than the other parts of
her body, she was allowed to leave the bath. This application
was sufficient.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Typhus Fever</i> requires the same treatment as other fevers.
The packing-sheet must be changed every ten or fifteen
minutes: I have known it changed as much as fifty times
a day. When the patient is weary of lying in the packing-sheet,
he should be put into a tepid bath and well rubbed for
a time; and then lie quiet, with a packing-sheet doubled several
times from hips to arm-pits. Then packing-sheets should be
resorted to again. If the head is attacked, apply the head-bath
whilst lying in packing-sheet. Drink abundantly of water.</p>

<p>Packing sheets, tepid baths, and cold baths (the former often
repeated), are also the treatment for brain fever. When a<span class="pagenum" title="112"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112"></a></span>
patient was in a state of delirium, Priessnitz ordered her into a
cold bath for an hour.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Teething fever.</i>&mdash;Tepid head-bath&mdash;water gradually made
colder&mdash;applied to the back of the head for half an hour.</p>

<p>If this had not had the desired effect it was to have been
repeated after a short interval. Heating-bandages were to
have been applied from the hips to the arm-pits.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Gastric Fever.</i>&mdash;A young man attacked with gastric fever,
was treated as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Two packing-sheets, one after the other, until warm, followed,
by tepid bath, in which he was rubbed fifteen minutes, then
put into cold bath for one minute, and from that back again to
the tepid bath for fifteen minutes; patient was then dried,
waited a few minutes, and then the bathing as above was twice
repeated.</p>

<p>The whole of the treatment, <i>i. e.</i> packing sheet and baths,
was repeated three times during the day; between which, a
sitz-bath of half an hour was prescribed.</p>

<p>Patient was cured in two days, and then declared himself
stronger and better than he was previously to the attack.</p>


<p class="mt15em">A gentleman aged thirty-four was thus treated:&mdash;</p>

<p>Packing-sheets twice a day until warm, followed by tepid
bath.</p>

<p>Two sitz-baths a day, twenty minutes each. Patient&rsquo;s back,
shoulders, abdomen and chest to be rubbed the whole time
whilst taking the sitting-baths.</p>

<p>Patient having lost his appetite, Priessnitz recommended
him to eat plentifully of common unripe plums: these
deranged his stomach, of which he was immediately cured;
and afterwards his appetite was better.</p>


<p class="mt15em">My servant was seized with violent pains in the abdomen
during the night, and in the morning head-ache and fever.
Dr. Farr of Nice, who saw the case, said depletion was requisite,
and that the man might be well in four or five days. I declared
with Hydropathy he might be made to wait at table the same
day. He was put into a packing-sheet for an hour and a half,
then a bath; an hour afterwards a sitz-bath; wore the ban<span class="pagenum" title="113"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113"></a></span>dage
and required no further treatment. Dr. F&mdash;&mdash;, until the
next morning could not believe that the fever was subdued.</p>


<p class="mt15em">Capt. D&mdash;&mdash; ordered, in the morning, two packing-sheets
until warm, with head in a basin of cold water all the time;
followed by tepid bath, renewed with cold; noon, cold sitz-bath
one hour; afternoon, morning treatment repeated.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Bilious Fever.</i>&mdash;A female attacked with bilious fever, swelled
face, and violent tooth-ache. Patient in the first instance,
preferred consulting a medical man, who administered a strong
aperient; ordered the feet to be kept in a hot bath for an hour,
and said the fever would certainly last seven days, if not
longer.</p>

<p>I applied a packing-sheet, and changed it after twenty
minutes; then two rubbing-sheets. Head-bath 62° for a quarter
of an hour: hot-water poultice to face. This treatment completely
subdued the fever the second day.</p>


<p class="mt15em">Patient attacked with bilious fever, swelled face, and violent
tooth-ache.</p>

<p>Packing-sheet for twenty, and another for thirty minutes;
then two rubbing-sheets, twice a day; head-bath 62°, and sitz-bath
62°; hot water bandage to face.</p>

<p>On a return of the same in the spring of the next year:
morning, packing-sheet and rubbing-sheet; noon, sitz-bath
62°; afternoon, sitz-bath and foot-bath 62°; the swollen part
of the face put into cold water fifteen minutes, twice a day.
This treatment answered admirably.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Nervous Fever.</i>&mdash;Commencement of patient&rsquo;s illness was
attended with violent headache and excessive weakness particularly
in his legs&mdash;unable to stand. Ordered four rubbing-sheets,
not wrung out, four times a day; head-baths three or
four times a day; fever, notwithstanding, increased, and,
patient was unable to bear the rubbing-sheet: upon which
the treatment was changed to four packing-sheets, renewed
every quarter of an hour, followed by a tepid bath for ten
minutes. This process was repeated three times during the
day.</p>

<p>Head became feverish. He took for this, a head-bath five<span class="pagenum" title="114"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114"></a></span>
minutes at a time. In a fortnight, fever left him completely;
when only three packing-sheets a day, and cold bath after
each, was ordered. In three weeks, patient was out of doors.</p>

<p>In the second week of his treatment, patient, besides several
small eruptions, had five large boils, which opened in the first
week, and discharged copiously for a fortnight, when his
health improved daily; and before the expiration of the sixth
week, he was perfectly well.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Remains of Fever strongly resembling Gout.</i>&mdash;An artist caught
a fever in Egypt. In Rome, his fingers and feet became enlarged,
in appearance resembling gout, when he was treated
for that complaint. Priessnitz at once declared this a mistake,
and that it was the remains of the fever.</p>

<p>In three or four days after beginning the cure, patient had
fever, and in ten days another strong attack: his feet and legs
became much inflamed, attended with headache and great
debility.</p>

<p>His former treatment was now abandoned for the following:</p>

<p>Three packing-sheets, one after the other, until warm; then
the tepid bath for fifteen minutes: from that into the cold bath
for two minutes, and return to the tepid again for fifteen or
twenty minutes. This was to be repeated in the afternoon.
When fever subsided, patient renewed his former treatment,
and was perfectly cured in three months. I saw him in Rome
the next year, when he was perfectly well; and as an act of
gratitude to Mr. Priessnitz, he had caused to be painted a
picture of the &ldquo;eternal city,&rdquo; to send for his acceptance.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Intermittent Fever.</i>&mdash;General R&mdash;&mdash; was attacked with intermittent
fever at the siege of Mantua, in 1798. His complaint
resisted all remedies: his liver became hardened and enlarged,
exhibiting a tumour extending three fingers&rsquo; breadth above his
navel. Came to Gräfenberg thin as a skeleton, complexion
nearly livid, unable to walk without the assistance of two
persons. Obstinate indigestion and constipation; no motion
for fifteen years, without aid; congestion of blood to the
head, and threatened apoplexy; insupportable sensitiveness
to cold. Arrived at Gräfenberg in 1839; now restored to
health: liver restored to normal size, with merely a slight
swelling at epigastric region.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="115"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115"></a></span></p>

<p>His treatment was:&mdash;morning, partial baths (tepid), twenty
minutes, with strong friction; no water in the bath when
patient first entered it, that being poured over his head and
shoulders.</p>

<p>After one month of this treatment, sweating for half an
hour, followed by partial bath for five minutes; noon, tepid
sitz-bath (70 deg.) for half an hour; repeated in the afternoon.</p>

<p>In two months patient could walk alone. During the third
month, sweating for an hour, and partial cold bath for five
minutes; and sitz-baths were now cold; eighteen glasses of
water, drunk daily; fourth month:&mdash;after sweating, the large
plunge-bath, and friction by two men; twenty to twenty-four
glasses of water, daily. Fifth month:&mdash;appetite good; commenced
ascending the mountains. The douche found to excite
too much: therefore abandoned.</p>

<p>August, 1840:&mdash;Left Gräfenberg: his liver softer, though
not sensibly diminished. Recommended, whilst at home, to
wear heating bandages always, and use cold ablutions, but
not to transpire, unless pain of liver occurs.</p>

<p>In January, 1841, eruptions on the skin, and many ulcers,
made their appearance.</p>

<p>August, 1841, returned to Gräfenberg, and commenced
the same treatment as before: sweating one hour; plunge-bath
and two partial baths a day; douche for five minutes every
other day.</p>

<p>In November, had fever for twenty-five days, and pains in
his hands, with open sores on his fingers for nine months; nails
dropped off, and were replaced by new ones; fingers always
wrapped in heating bandages. For the fever, six packing-sheets,
changed every quarter of an hour, except the last: in
this the patient remained longer, preparatory to a warm bath.</p>

<p>This was renewed twice a day.</p>

<p>Twenty-four glasses of water daily.</p>

<p>March, 1842.&mdash;Left Gräfenberg: liver reduced to one-half
the size it was.</p>

<p>August, 1842.&mdash;Returned again to Gräfenberg, when his
treatment was:&mdash;packing-sheet every morning one hour,
followed by two rubbing-sheets; noon and afternoon, two rubbing-sheets.</p>

<p>October, 1842.&mdash;Was seen at his residence in health; pains
from many old wounds no longer felt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="116"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116"></a></span></p>

<p>Patient aged forty-five. Ten years ago; caught cold, which
ended in intermittent fever, which resisted the usual remedies;
was cured at Gräfenberg as follows:&mdash;morning, packing-sheet
and plunge-bath; noon, rubbing-sheet and sitz-bath; afternoon,
as the morning.</p>

<p>Fever and ague returned every fourth day, when treatment
was changed. Packing-sheet and tepid bath 62°, ten minutes;
then into cold bath two minutes, and back again to tepid, with
much friction; at noon, five rubbing-sheets; afternoon, as
in the morning. The paroxysm over, resumed the former
treatment until perfectly cured.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Fever and Ague.</i>&mdash;S&mdash;&mdash; had fever, attended with ague;
took nine packing and six rubbing-sheets, and three tepid
baths; two of the tepid baths being followed by cold plunging
bath. Cured the same day.</p>


<p class="mt15em">A lady attacked by slight fever and shivering, cured by five
rubbing-sheets.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Sudden Fever.</i>&mdash;Mrs. H&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;s little boy awoke with fever;
she kept him in a tepid bath, renewed with cold, until he
trembled with cold; then put him to bed, where he immediately
fell asleep, and awoke perfectly well. Priessnitz said the mother
would have done as well, if she had given him a long sitz-bath.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Catarrh and Fever.</i>&mdash;Child restless all night. Tepid bath
(nearly cold) for a quarter of an hour; lean back in the
bath so that the attendant may well rub the chest and
throat. Afternoon, rubbing-sheet and tepid bath for a quarter
of an hour.</p>

<p>After each bath, a head-bath for twelve minutes, each side
of the head being alternately placed in the water. If this does
not succeed, lay the back of the head in water, and well rub
the forehead with wet hands. Rub the throat with wet hands
three times a day. Eat no meat, and be much out of doors.
Child, after first day&rsquo;s treatment, wretchedly cold; but pain in
the head gone, and cough decreased.</p>

<p>Second day, pain in his legs, and weak; which Priessnitz
said was the result of the fever. As the cough abated, treatment<span class="pagenum" title="117"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117"></a></span>
was moderated. Bath to be tepid. In the middle of the
day, throat and chest to be rubbed. In the evening, a tepid
bath eight minutes; head-bath as before; these were given in
consequence of his feverish state in the night. If the body
continued feverish, and the feet and legs cold at night, then
heating bandages to the feet and legs, up to the fork, would
have been applied all night.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Fever and Diarrh&oelig;a.</i>&mdash;A Servant of my own, disturbed many
times during the night with diarrh&oelig;a and fever, and with violent
pain in his head and abdomen, was put into a packing-sheet
for one hour and a quarter; a rubbing-sheet was then
applied, followed by bandage round the waist; at noon, sitz-bath
one hour and a quarter. This simple treatment effected a cure
in a few hours.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Constipation and Fever.</i>&mdash;Patient took tepid-bath, rubbed by
three men for one hour and a half, getting out of the bath
was dried and walked about the room every half-hour for
ten minutes; followed by other treatment.</p>

<p>Second day, the above repeated twice, with the addition of
packing-sheets and rubbing-sheets, in the interim.</p>

<p>General laxity of the bowels for several days, rest disturbed for
two or three nights; could not rest the last night, diarrh&oelig;a
and fever, strong pulse (110).</p>

<p>Morning, two packing-sheets, fifteen minutes each. In the
first, patient felt (as he said) as though he was in boiling
water; on the application of the second he felt cooler, after
twenty-five minutes he was put into a cold bath and there remained
until heat had left the arm-pits, which required seventeen
minutes. Then a large towel was doubled four times
and placed round his loins, drank six tumblers of water and
went to bed.</p>

<p>At twelve o&rsquo;clock all fever gone&mdash;to put an end to
Diarrh&oelig;a, I ordered two rubbing sheets three minutes each,
to be followed by tepid sitz-bath fifteen minutes, wet bandages
and water to be drank as before.</p>

<p>At five o&rsquo;clock sitz-bath twenty minutes.</p>

<p>Patient passed a good night, and next day found himself
well.</p>

<p>P.S. I treated this case myself at Naples.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="118"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118"></a></span></p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Cold Shivering by Day, and Feverish Heat when in Bed at
Night.</i>&mdash;A young man&mdash;ordered three rubbing-sheets on rising
quite warm from bed in the morning; the same at noon, and in
the afternoon drink plentifully of water.</p>

<p>Symptoms continuing&mdash;An additional three rubbing-sheets
were used previous to going to bed, and when heat commenced
in the night, the body bandage, which had been worn
from the beginning was changed, and water drunk. If in a
state of perspiration early in the morning, a tepid bath. This
treatment had the desired effect.</p>


<h3>XXXIX.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Congestion of the Lungs.</span></h3>

<p>When the lungs are unsound sitz-baths are liable to cause a
pain to be felt in that region, probably from causing congestion
to them. I knew a case of this kind, and named it to
Priessnitz who said, to have relieved this the patient should
have been put into a very shallow tepid-bath, water two inches
deep, and there rubbed by two men until the pain was
removed.</p>

<p>In a case of Gout treated by an inexperienced person&mdash;where
fears were entertained that congestion had taken place
and castor oil was resorted to&mdash;he advised the same bath and
friction, <i>until it</i> was removed.</p>

<p>A third case, where after being some time under the treatment
a practitioner was embarrassed by his patient having
fixed pain in his bowels, Priessnitz said, the bath applied with
vigour for a considerable time would have been sure of removing
it.</p>

<p>If a patient is ever lost in these cases, it is through the
want of knowledge and the timidity of the practitioner.</p>


<h3>XL.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Inflammations.</span></h3>

<p><i>Inflammation of the Lungs.</i>&mdash;This complaint originates in
some obstruction, and is occasioned by an effort of nature to
remove it. By bleeding the symptoms are reduced, but the
cause remains, and consequently it frequently happens that
under Hydropathic treatment inflammation returns, which
then, by producing irritation on the surface, is extracted.</p>

<p>Mr. Priessnitz&rsquo; married daughter, this year, returned to<span class="pagenum" title="119"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119"></a></span>
Gräfenberg, with her husband, to be cured of an epidemic
which raged in Hungary. The husband was cured. The
lady, with an eruption, went for two days into the country; on
return the eruption had nearly subsided; it had gone to the
lungs and inflammation resulted. She was put into tepid and
cold baths thirty or forty times during the day. These
positive means put an end to the inflammation in one day, and
the next she was about as usual, quite well.</p>

<p>This apparently dangerous complaint, without any apparent
cause, when taken quite in its infancy, is generally cured by
the following simple means.</p>

<p>Place a cold packing-sheet several times doubled over the
shoulders, chest, and back of the patient, whilst he takes a
cold sitz-bath, for from half an hour to an hour, during the
time use great friction to the feet and legs with hands dipped
in water. All medical reasoning will be to the effect that this
treatment must cause congestion to the lungs; but every day&rsquo;s
practice at Gräfenberg proves the contrary.</p>

<p>Between the application of the above treatment, use a rubbing
sheet.</p>

<p>If the head is affected, let the patient lay quiet in bed, with
his head in a basin once or twice a day, from fifteen to thirty
minutes, or much longer if necessary each time.</p>

<p>If fever, then resort to the tepid bath, until heat disappears
under the arm-pits; this may require a long time, but must be
persevered in.</p>

<p>The water of the bath must be continually renewed or it
will become too warm.</p>

<p>I have known the sitz-bath, applied two or three times a
day, completely cure an attack of this nature.</p>

<p class="mt15em">A lady, aged forty, attacked with inflammation of the lungs,
was put into a tepid bath 62°, and kept there three hours and
ten minutes, cold water being constantly poured over the
shoulders, to bring down the temperature. Priessnitz frequently
felt the chest and arm-pits; and in answer to patient&rsquo;s request
to discontinue, he said if she did so until all parts were cool
alike, her life would pay the forfeit.</p>

<p>After this, she took a cold bath twice a day, and wore the
heating-bandage. In two months, she was perfectly cured. It
should be remarked, that during the greater part of this<span class="pagenum" title="120"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120"></a></span>
times she felt a pain and hardness in the side, but this all
subsided.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Spitting Blood and Inflammation.</i>&mdash;A young man had inflammation
of the lungs at Vienna, which ended in great debility
and spitting of blood. Shortly after going to Gräfenberg he
had another attack of inflammation of the lungs.</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i>&mdash;Tepid bath 62°, five minutes, then cold ten
minutes, and back to the tepid ten minutes. This change
from one bath to the other was repeated for nearly three hours,
and ended about nine in the morning; at eleven o&rsquo;clock, a
sitz-bath fifteen minutes; afternoon, packing-sheet and cold
bath for five minutes. Next day quite well of the attack; he
continued packing-sheet and cold bath, morning and afternoon,
and sitz-bath at noon; more heating-bandages on the
chest. In ten weeks perfectly cured.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Inflammation in the Wind-pipe.</i>&mdash;A lady&mdash;Chest, throat, and
between the shoulders rubbed for five minutes with hands, and
frequently dipped in cold water. During this time water was
held in the mouth and changed when warm.</p>

<p>Bandages were applied to throat, shoulders, and waist.</p>

<p>Walked the same afternoon a short time.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Inflammation of the Brain.</i>&mdash;Rubbing-sheets, head-baths, and
bandages to the nape of the neck, back of the head, and some
distance down the back, the rest of the body lightly covered.
In an obstinate case, recourse must be had to a tepid bath
64° for a considerable time.</p>

<p>In all cases, whether in fever or not, where the head is
attacked, large wet bandages may be applied, and changed
every five minutes. Bandages to the whole of the head should
not however be applied in general practice. The head ought
to be free and the face washed often.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Inflammation of the Gums.</i>&mdash;A child suffering indescribable
pain, no sleep night or day.</p>

<p>One or two rubbing sheets, two or three times a day. Heating
bandages to be applied to the head, as a turban, so that
only the face can be seen, and changed every five or ten
minutes. The same round the waist, from the hips to the arm-pits,
and changed when warm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="121"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121"></a></span></p>

<p>If the body is confined, administer a cold water enema; if
one is not sufficient, a second should be administered in half an
hour; drink plentifully of water. Child out at play the third
day.</p>


<h3>XLI.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Gripes, Cholic, Diarrh&oelig;a, English Cholera,
or Cholera Morbus.</span></h3>

<p>All partake more or less of the same character; to describe the
symptoms, nature, and medical treatment of these complaints,
more volumes have been written than there are days in the
year.</p>

<p>My object is not to inquire how such complaints arise, but
to show how by the most simple and safe means they are to be
cured.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Cholic.</i>&mdash;This complaint invariably gives way to sitz-baths,
clysters, bandages, and drinking plentifully of cold water.</p>

<p>A patient suffering from pain in the bowels for some days,
was ordered injections three times a day, notwithstanding the
bowels were perfectly free.</p>


<p class="mt15em">W&mdash;&mdash;, taken with sickness and griping pains, could retain
nothing on his stomach, supposed that it arose from eating
unripe fruit. An injection of cold water was first resorted to;
one not being sufficient, a second in half an hour was administered,
and during the day ten others. Then two rubbing
sheets, followed by a tepid bath, with great friction, and large
bandage, three hours afterwards, a sitz-bath, tepid, fifteen
minutes.</p>

<p>Again, after a lapse of three hours, the former process.
This put an end to the gripes the same day.</p>


<p class="mt15em">An Austrian officer, attacked with violent pain in the abdomen,
which extended through to the back. Great heat and
pain in the head, with cold feet.</p>

<p>Priessnitz wetted the body all over with cold water, particularly
the feet, and without drying the parts thus wetted, ordered
the patient to sit quite naked near to the window, which was
open, for one hour in a sitz-bath, his servant rubbing him
the whole time. Patient was then covered up well in bed to<span class="pagenum" title="122"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122"></a></span>
bring on re-action, the pains of which for a short time were
worse than cholic. The attack was put an end to by this one
application, or it was to have been renewed in the morning.</p>

<p>The singular part of this treatment is, that the body was
thus exposed to the inclemency of a Siberian winter, wet and
naked, for one hour. When asked why he adopted such positive
treatment, Priessnitz said, because there was a great tendency
to intestinal inflammation. The patient was out and
well next day.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Dysentery and Diarrh&oelig;a.</i>&mdash;For the information of the
general reader, it may be well to state, that Dysentery is
brought on by damp, cold, or unripe fruit, and is attended by
the evacuation of bloody glaires, violent pain of the stomach,
burning at the arms, and spasms of the bladder, a constant
desire to evacuate without being able to render anything but
glaires. Diarrh&oelig;a is attended with many of these symptoms,
but there is no blood in the evacuation. Hereafter it will be
shewn how both these complaints are to be treated.</p>

<p>Cold clysters, rubbing-sheets, sitz-baths, and bandage, are
the chief agents in the cure of these complaints. When attended
with inflammation take three or four sitz-baths a day, and
change the body bandages every ten minutes.</p>

<p>In Diarrh&oelig;a or Dysentery the patient should take but little
exercise.</p>

<p>When Diarrh&oelig;a is recent, it is sufficient to drink plentifully
of water, wear a bandage round the wrist, eat little, and that
of farinaceous food.</p>

<p>Diarrh&oelig;a is often the work of nature to carry off prejudicial
humours; which ought not to be prevented. At the same
time it must not be suffered to continue too long without resorting
to measures to check it. A patient came to Gräfenberg
who had suffered six weeks from this complaint, which had
reduced him almost to a skeleton. He was cured in a few days.</p>

<p>Where abundant evacuations of glaires are alternate with
constipation, cold injections are a great relief. If patients in
Cholera, Diarrh&oelig;a, Cholic, or Dysentery, cannot sleep, administer
a very cold foot-bath, water only half an inch deep, for
fifteen minutes. Let the feet, legs, and thighs be rubbed with
wet hands the whole time, then the patient should walk bare-footed
in the chamber for ten minutes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="123"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123"></a></span></p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Dysentery.</i>&mdash;Begin with one or two rubbing-sheets, then
cold injections every quarter of an hour for two or three
hours.</p>

<p>Then tepid sitz-bath, rather warmer than usual, for half an
hour, followed by a large heating bandage doubled three or
four times, from before the hips to the arm-pits, leaving the
arms free. Change this every ten or fifteen minutes. Let the
covering to the bed be light, but keep the feet warm. Drink
large quantities of cold water.</p>

<p>When the bandage has been changed three or four times, if
the patient is better, let him remain quiet; otherwise repeat
the treatment.</p>


<p class="mt15em">Miss B&mdash;&mdash;, attacked with dysentery attended with great
pain; ordered four sitz-baths in a day, one hour each large
bandage from hips to arm-pits; changed often.</p>

<p>Took them two days, and one in the night. These chilled
her exceedingly, which Priessnitz said was as it ought to be.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Diarrh&oelig;a.</i>&mdash;A delicate lady, ordered not to drink milk for
some days, but sixteen to twenty glasses of water; take but
little exercise; at noon wash with cold water; at eleven o&rsquo;clock,
cold sitz-bath, twenty minutes, then walk a few times in the
room, with only dry sheet over the person; then sitz-bath
again for twenty minutes; repeat this a third time to complete
the hour.</p>


<p class="mt15em">F&mdash;&mdash;, had diarrh&oelig;a two days, when Priessnitz said, &ldquo;If
you are not in pain, do nothing; if the contrary, take a morning
rubbing-sheet, and sitz-bath three quarters of an hour;
noon, the same; afternoon, sitz-bath three quarters of an
hour; change bandages and walk less; drink plentifully of
water.&rdquo;</p>


<p class="mt15em">A&mdash;&mdash; had Diarrh&oelig;a whilst travelling, as he could not procure
sitz-bath, he lay in bed, changed bandages every half hour,
and drank freely of water. This treatment sufficed.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Chronic Diarrh&oelig;a.</i>&mdash;Morning, packing-sheet from hips to
arm-pits until warm, then cold bath; noon, two rubbing-sheets
and sitz-bath half-an-hour; evening, sitz-bath half-an-hour; or<span class="pagenum" title="124"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124"></a></span>
in the morning, sitz-bath for half an hour, then walk, return
and take cold bath; drink plentifully of water and wear large
bandages.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Pain in the Bowels.</i>&mdash;Tepid sitz-bath 62° for three quarters
of an hour; rubbing the abdomen all the time; in a simple
case this puts an end to the pain at once.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Severe Pain in the Bowels.</i>&mdash;Tepid sitz-bath, half an hour to
an hour; much rubbing with wet hands on the back, stomach,
and abdomen when in the bath; no exertion of mind or body;
eat only of one thing; drink much water. When constipated,
or had pain in the bowels, extended the period of the sitz
bath. Patient&rsquo;s recovery quite marvellous.</p>

<p>The sitz-bath may be resorted to two or three times a day,
and also rubbing-sheet, if the case proves obstinate.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Pain in Bowels and Diarrh&oelig;a.</i>&mdash;Ordered sitz-bath fifteen
minutes, walk gently about the room five minutes, then repeat
the sitz-bath fifteen minutes, and again walk for five minutes,
and after third time take sitz-bath. Put on a large bandage
well wrung out, and change it every quarter of an hour. If
not cured in three or four hours, repeat the above treatment.
If obstinate use cold injections.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Relaxed Bowels.</i>&mdash;Three rubbing-sheets and a sitz-bath on
rising from bed, for ten minutes in the morning; one rubbing
sheet, and sitz-bath twenty minutes at noon; the same repeated
in the afternoon. If not better, a clyster of cold water on going
to bed; bandage, and drink water as usual.</p>


<p class="mt15em">A young lady, troubled with relaxed bowels for some
days&mdash;</p>

<p>Morning, three rubbing-sheets, and immediately after, tepid
bath for fifteen minutes; large bandage; at two o&rsquo;clock two
rubbing sheets.</p>

<p>These simple means effected a cure; if they had not, the sitz-bath
was to have been resorted to again.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>English Cholera.</i>&mdash;A Russian General attacked with English
Cholera, was suffering extreme torture when Priessnitz came.<span class="pagenum" title="125"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125"></a></span>
He ordered three rubbing-sheets, five minutes interim between
each; patient then to be put to bed for half-an-hour, and well
covered up to promote heat; this was followed by a cold sitz-bath
of 30 or 40 minutes; drank plentifully of water and wore
a large heating bandage.</p>

<p>This one application effected a complete cure; had it not,
the General was to have repeated the treatment in the
afternoon.</p>


<h3>XLII.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Consumption.</span></h3>

<p>Mr. Priessnitz thinks that in the great majority of cases consumption
is curable until the age of fourteen or fifteen, when
the complaint generally assumes a more serious aspect.</p>

<p>Young people are often considered consumptive when they
really are not so. A young lady of my acquaintance, having
all the symptoms, was ordered to Italy, where, notwithstanding
the climate, the malady seemed to increase. She went to
Gräfenberg, when Mr. Priessnitz at once declared it was not
consumption, that it was a contraction of the chest. Two
months&rsquo; treatment caused the chest to expand and restored
the patient to robust health. Dr. Johnson says,
&ldquo;One thing of which I am convinced is, that the true
principle of treating consumption is to support the patient&rsquo;s
strength to the utmost;&rdquo; and it must be remembered
that the great aim and principal effect of the
Water-cure is to <i>strengthen the system</i>, thereby giving the
inherent curative power the fairest opportunity of doing its
own work.</p>

<p>It must however be observed, that when consumption has
fairly set in, neither water or drugs will arrest its progress.
A friend of mine writes me most sensibly on this subject: &ldquo;I
fully believe,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;if all girls were to <i>wash thoroughly
every</i> day, more than three-fourths who now go into consumption
would be saved.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>XLIII.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Cramps.</span></h3>

<p>Rubbing-sheets, and rubbing powerfully with wet hands, for
a considerable time, particularly the feet, are efficient means of
cure; after each application let the patient remain quiet. If<span class="pagenum" title="126"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126"></a></span>
the hands or feet become cold, apply friction again to them
and the parts affected.</p>

<p>Mr. Brown finding patient nearly dead from Cramp, immediately
administered an enema, then a rubbing-sheet with
great friction, followed by a tepid bath for nearly an hour, the
enema took effect whilst under the friction, rubbing-sheets
and baths were repeated three times before mid-day with good
effect.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, rubbing-sheets were used, and friction
with wet hands.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Cramp-Cough.</i>&mdash;I knew a case of this nature which was most
successfully treated at Gräfenberg.</p>

<p>Morning, two or three packing-sheets followed by tepid
bath; noon, tepid sitz-bath, quarter of an hour; afternoon,
morning treatment renewed.</p>

<p>The Crisis was attended with inflammation and ulcers of
the throat.</p>

<p>Tepid-baths, were administered twice a day, for ten to
fifteen minutes, changing alternately from hot to cold and
back to hot. To subdue fever which was very active in the
night, the patient took a plunge or two into a cold bath before
going to bed.</p>

<p>Bandage on Chest at night, in addition to that round the
loins.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Cramps in the Stomach.</i>&mdash;Patient&rsquo;s complaint was cramp
in the stomach, weak digestion, great nervous sensibility.
Packing-sheet one hour, and tepid-bath in the morning, four
minutes, with great friction; then three successive plunges
into tepid, cold, and tepid-bath, to remain in the last four
minutes; noon, rubbing-sheet five minutes, followed by sitz-bath
ten minutes; afternoon, repeat morning treatment, wear
bandage day and night, and drink twelve tumblers of water
daily.</p>

<p>In a short time, the tepid-bath was relinquished for the
cold-bath; and the douche was used for two minutes, as a
longer period was found to disagree with the patient. A
diarrh&oelig;a was cured by the addition of sitz-baths; at which
time the douche was not persevered in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="127"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127"></a></span></p>


<h3>XLIV.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Asthma.</span></h3>

<p>I was astonished at the wonderful effects of the Water-cure
treatment, in cases of Asthma. One night, Priessnitz was
called up to a patient under the cure, who was almost
suffocated.</p>

<p>A tepid sitz-bath for thirty minutes with great friction of
the abdomen completely relieved him. This patient was perfectly
cured in three months.</p>


<p class="mt15em">A patient whose age was thirty-five suffered from chest
complaint, asthma, torpid circulation, and stricture. For some
time three rubbing-sheets a day only were prescribed, then a
tepid sitz-bath; and when he evidenced the cure of the Asthma,
by ascending with ease the highest mountains, the general
treatment was resorted to.</p>

<p>In three months the stricture was quite cured. Left Gräfenberg
the fourth month.</p>


<p class="mt15em">The following interesting case, came under my especial
notice.</p>

<p>Mr. M&mdash;&mdash;, aged 26, afflicted with Asthma for three years,
tried all the baths in Germany, and then determined on
going to Gräfenberg: <i>en route</i>, he was confined to an hotel
for eight days. When he arrived, which was on the 4th
January, 1846, he could with difficulty walk a quarter of a
mile.</p>

<p>Inclement as the weather was, Priessnitz, at once ordered him
into a tepid bath, and stripped him of all flannels; next day he
began the following treatment, until warm.</p>

<p>Morning, packing-sheet, tepid-bath; noon, rubbing-sheet,
and tepid sitz-bath; afternoon, the same. In a short time tepid
water was discontinued for cold.</p>

<p>In about three weeks, two large boils appeared and broke,
when he was so much better, as to ascend the highest mountains,
his health improved so fast, that, first in the morning,
he was seen up to his middle in snow, always without hat,
neckcloth or great coat.</p>

<p>He was cured in about four months.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="128"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128"></a></span></p>


<h3>XLV.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Surgical Operations, Accidents, etc.</span></h3>

<p><i>Amputation.</i>&mdash;The Surgeon&rsquo;s profession would be a very poor
one if Hydropathy were generally understood.</p>

<p>If a finger, hand, or foot, be nearly severed from the body,
they should be put into the best possible form, bandaged, and
placed between two pieces of wood; over this a large bandage:
the former may be wetted often without being removed.</p>

<p>A friend of mine in Italy had the misfortune, whilst botanising,
to fall from one rock to another, where he hung by his
foot. This caused a compound fracture, and the loss of his
foot. I asked Mr. Priessnitz what ought to have been done,&mdash;he
said his shepherd would have known better than to have
cut off the foot; a stiff one being preferable to none at all.
The foot should have been healed as above described, a large
bandage applied from the toes up to the top of the thighs
constantly wetted; this would have kept the limb cold. As
fever or inflammation must proceed from the part afflicted, it
is evident if the heat is extracted thence, neither can ensue.
The splinters would have come away of themselves, and the
patient might have been spared the loss of his foot, and several
months of severe suffering and loss of health.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Crushed Finger.</i>&mdash;A farmer at Gräfenberg had his finger
smashed by a large stone rolling against it; so that it hung
by the skin. It was put together, bandaged, and so fixed
between two pieces of wood; over this a larger bandage was
placed, the under part kept constantly wet. When pain ensued,
the elbow was put into cold water for twenty minutes.
The finger, though stiffer than the others, was preserved.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Fainting Fit.</i>&mdash;Open the window to admit fresh air; unfasten
the dress. Sprinkle water on the face and put the feet into a
foot pan, with water only up to the instep, and let the attendant
rub feet and legs up to the knees.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Effects of Falls.</i>&mdash;A young man who came with nervous
fever, one day, whilst labouring under violent palpitation, to
which he was subject, fell, and so hurt the back of his head,
as to be insensible for half an hour. Priessnitz, being sent for,<span class="pagenum" title="129"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129"></a></span>
ordered a foot-bath and rubbing with wet hands up to the
knee. Opened his waistcoat, rubbed the chest, and threw cold
water into his face. The friction and foot-bath continued for
an hour, when patient was ordered a sitz-bath for thirty
minutes. Bandages to waist and head.</p>


<p class="mt15em">Another party fell and injured his large toe against a stone.
Ordered three cold foot-baths a day, fifteen minutes each time,
and bandage to be kept continually wet.</p>


<p class="mt15em">Count C. fell down stairs, and afterwards felt pain in his side.
Bandaged the part. Next day a tepid bath for one hour. As
the Count was not young, this was not persevered in. Sitz-baths
were substituted.</p>


<p class="mt15em">A. fell from his horse and injured his elbow and arm.</p>

<p>Arm and elbow placed in a tepid bath for an hour.</p>

<p>Repeated three times a day. Arm bandaged night and day.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Bruised Shin.</i>&mdash;Three sitz-baths a day 60°; bandage the leg
from ancle to above the knee, and keep it raised. Throw
tepid water over foot and leg several times a day.</p>

<p>Foot-baths may be resorted to, if the patient is already under
hydropathic treatment: otherwise not, as they draw bad matter
downwards, and might prevent the wound from healing.</p>


<p class="mt15em">B. trod upon a nail which entered his foot. His foot was
put for an hour twice or thrice a day into tepid water, and
he wore a bandage on the part.</p>

<p>In all cases of the kind&mdash;either by cutting with sharp instruments
or otherwise, put the wounded part into tepid water
until it ceases bleeding, then bandage it, and afterwards
use cold baths several times a day to the part.</p>

<p>Bandages must extend both ways beyond the wound, to
carry off the inflammation from the part. Viz.&mdash;If the calf
of the leg be wounded, the bandage ought to begin at the
ancle, and be continued up to the knee. In all cases take one
or two tepid sitz-baths a day. They prevent the head being
affected.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Tape Worms.</i>&mdash;Rubbing-sheets once or twice a day, bandage<span class="pagenum" title="130"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130"></a></span>
always round the waist, cold injections morning and evening,
and drink plentifully of water.</p>

<p>For other worms recourse must be had to the general
treatment.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Sea Sickness.</i>&mdash;Wear a large thick bandage on chest and
abdomen; and if it does not prevent, it will mitigate sea-sickness.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Apoplexy and Paralysis.</i>&mdash;Instantly put patient into tepid-bath,
water about two inches deep, throw cold water over
head and shoulders, and use immense friction with wet hands
for a very long time. For a wonderful case of cure of Apoplexy,
refer to the <a href="#To_the_Editor_of_the_Tribune">letter</a> written from Gräfenberg to the New
York Tribune.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Lock Jaw.</i>&mdash;The same as for Apoplexy.</p>


<p class="mt15em">A Belgian Doctor had a paralytic stroke two months
previous to coming to Gräfenberg. In a fortnight he had
another; when he could neither speak nor eat, and was too
feeble to take the bath.</p>

<p>Sixteen rubbing-sheets a day, four at a time, restored him
the use of his faculties in two days.</p>


<p class="mt15em">A crochet-needle was, by accident, driven into the side of a
young lady; a surgeon lanced the part and extracted it, when
Priessnitz simply ordered a bandage to the part, to be changed
every quarter of an hour until inflammation subsided, and
subsequently, as often as it became dry. After the first day
no inconvenience was felt. A green matter exuded from the
wound, which P. said was nothing more than usual in such
circumstances.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Scalds.</i>&mdash;Put the part affected into cold water, or apply a
cold affusion for an hour two or three times a day. Wear a
bandage continually wet; when the inflammation has subsided,
put a dry bandage over the wet one.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Burns.</i>&mdash;If a burn be bad, and the patient cannot endure the
application of water, in that case use tow or lint; but if possible,<span class="pagenum" title="131"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131"></a></span>
wring a bandage well out, apply it to the burn, and put a
dry one over it. Change the bandage often; but if this is too
painful, let it remain, and wet it often. A cold bath applied
as a derivative will afford great relief; <i>i. e.</i> if the leg is burnt
take a foot-bath; if the hand, put the elbow in cold water, &amp;c.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Rupture of the Tendon Achilles.</i>&mdash;A friend of mine, running
across the road, heard the crack of a whip; and supposed at
first that some one had struck his leg with a whip, but he
soon found he could not put his foot to the ground, that he
had met with an accident called <i>coup de fouet</i>, or a rupture of
the tendon Achilles in the calf of his leg. The only treatment
for this, which effected an immediate cure, was binding it up
in a surgeon&rsquo;s bandage very tight, and keeping that wet night
and day.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Accidents to the Head.</i>&mdash;A man chopping wood struck a
child a back blow on the forehead; the wound was wetted with
tepid water for some time, and then a bandage was applied.</p>

<p>Two tepid sitz-baths were administered during the day.</p>


<p class="mt15em">Another child seven years old, fell against a stone and laid
his forehead open.</p>

<p>Bandage applied, and wetted occasionally without being
taken off; a dry one kept over it.</p>

<p>Another bandage at the back of the neck, renewed often.</p>

<p>Tepid sitz-bath fifteen minutes, three times a day. Feverish
symptoms arose during the night; sitz-bath renewed.</p>

<p>Prince Ruspoli, Lord Anson, and another were galloping along
a road at the dusk of the evening, not perceiving a drain, two
of their horses fell into it. Two of the party were taken up
insensible. On being brought into Freywalden, they were
instantly put into tepid baths of 65°.</p>

<p>The prince having fallen on his temple was much stunned;
four men rubbed him in the bath, in five minutes he became
conscious and assisted in rubbing himself; in ten minutes he felt
cold. After being in the bath twenty-five minutes he was
taken out, well dried and put to bed, with bandages on his
head and back of the neck, and but slight covering. After an
hour&rsquo;s repose, a tepid sitz-bath was administered for an hour.
During the night patient suffered great pain in his head.<span class="pagenum" title="132"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132"></a></span>
Next day he was out of doors, but took three sitz-baths during
the day; in the morning for an hour; the others, half an hour
each time. Bandages always to the injured part. In a few
days he was quite well.</p>

<p>The prince&rsquo;s friend was threatened with congestion in the
head, and had great pain in the stomach; the fæces were nearly
black. He took many injections; three sitz-baths daily, an
hour and a half each time, and one during the night. This
treatment effected his cure.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Cuts and Wounds.</i>&mdash;For a clean cut, it will often be sufficient
to close the wound at once, and cover it with a dry bandage,
so as to exclude the air.</p>

<p>A bruise, or jagged cut, should be bound up, and covered
with a wet bandage; and this, when inflammation has subsided,
must be covered with a dry one. Do not remove the under
bandage, but pour water on it occasionally, and cover it again
with the dry one. Let the bandage extend both ways beyond
the wound, to conduct away the heat from it.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Calf of Leg torn off.</i>&mdash;Dr. Scontetton, surgeon to the forces
at Strasburg, states, &ldquo;A soldier trying to descend at night
from the walls of the barracks, fell, and tore the flesh off the
calf of his leg. The doctor put the lacerated flesh together as
well as he could, and bound the leg and thigh up in a bandage;
a trough was then made in a slanting position in which he
placed the leg. Over the man&rsquo;s head he fixed a cask of water
with a tube, from which the man was to keep the bandage
constantly wet.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> By this treatment alone a cure was effected
in a fortnight, during which time the man suffered no pain,
nor was even deprived of his appetite.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="mt15em"><i>Sprained Shoulder.</i>&mdash;A patient fell down an ice-berg and
severely bruised his shoulder, so that he could not raise his
hand. The bruise was immediately saturated with cold water for
an hour, and cold wet cloths applied for a long time. When
inflammation had subsided, a heating bandage was applied and
renewed when dry. Elbow bath twice a day, fifteen minutes
each.</p>

<p>This treatment was repeated two or three times a day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="133"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133"></a></span></p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Accident to the Eye.</i>&mdash;A child five years old, ran a knife into
the ball of the eye. Cold wet bandages perfected a cure. The
blue of the eye ran, but the boy, now fifteen years of age, sees
perfectly well.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Swelling of a Vein&mdash;Varicose Veins.</i>&mdash;A young lady was
afflicted with swelled vein just over the large toes of both
feet; the swelling in one foot shortly disappeared, the other
became more developed, the foot and ancle inflamed.</p>

<p>I wrote to Priessnitz, who advised &ldquo;a cold foot-bath, three
times a day, for twenty minutes; water up to the ancle and not
to be changed. After the bath, rub the foot (omitting the
affected part) and leg, particularly in front, up to the knee,
until heat is restored; then apply a bandage (well wrung out) to
the foot and leg up to the knee, always changing before dry. If an
eruption or swelling take place on the foot, take a sitz-bath
half an hour, twice a day, and the sweating process, followed
by cold bath every other day. Do not perspire more than an
hour. The foot should be kept a little elevated.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Patient not getting better, and the medical men declaring
the case, in their opinion, incurable, she went to Gräfenberg.
The following is the treatment pursued there:&mdash;Packing-sheets
for fifteen minutes; changed for another of twenty minutes;
and cold plunge-bath morning and evening; between which
douched twice a day, and a sitz-bath taken; always wearing
foot and leg and waist bandage.</p>

<p>Priessnitz, on seeing the case, declared the complaint was
not a local one, that &ldquo;it was a general derangement of the
nervous system&rdquo;, and so it turned out, as veins in the arms,
thighs, and elsewhere enlarged and diminished under the
treatment. Both feet and legs now became swollen and inflamed
up to the knee, so that patient was obliged to move on
crutches. Treatment increased. Length of cold bath and
douche extended to five minutes each. To prevent the pain
that must have attended the limbs, in so inflamed a state,
coming in contact with water, the bandages remained on
those parts whilst taking those baths. This crisis continued
for two months, when it began to recede, then came again in
a more moderate form; receded and again made its appearance
a third and last time. Catamenia became regular, appetite
good, and patient could walk without assistance. The cure<span class="pagenum" title="134"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134"></a></span>
was effected in ten months. It is now upwards of two years
since the party left Gräfenberg, and she is perfectly well.</p>

<p>By this it will be seen, that that which is produced by the
treatment, must be made to recede under the treatment. Had
Priessnitz relinquished any part of it at the most trying
moment, the cure would not have been effected.</p>

<p>Speaking to him of varicose or enlarged veins, he said
&ldquo;they are generally curable. I had a patient with an enlarged
vein in his foot, when on the ground the vein became full,
measuring nearly two inches; this was cured in eighteen
months.&rdquo;</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Sprains.</i>&mdash;In all cases of sprains, rub the part, with hands
dipped in water, for a long time; the oftener the better, and
put on a wet bandage, which when heat has subsided, change
for a heating bandage.</p>

<p>If the sprain is a bad one, apply a cold bath or cold affusion
to the part for half an hour, then the wet, and afterwards the
heating bandage, which change often.</p>

<p>The bath should be repeated thrice a day, and friction used
the whole time.</p>

<p>If general treatment is necessary, then packing-sheets.
Tepid bath and tepid sitting baths must be resorted to.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Sprained Ankle.</i>&mdash;Put the foot immediately into cold water,
and rub foot, ankle, and leg up to the knee for an hour, particularly
the wounded part. The water of the bath, after the
first time, only up to the instep, but repeated three or four
times a day. Bandage the foot, ankle, and leg up to the
knee; first, with quite wet bandages, and when inflammation
has somewhat subsided, then with heating bandage. The foot
should not be allowed to remain quiet. If not able to move
about, the patient should put a rolling pin under his foot and
keep that in movement. By these means a sprained ankle is
cured in a few days, that without it might continue for a
month or longer.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Wound in the Abdomen.</i>&mdash;A lad leaning upon a piece of
wood, hurt his abdomen; it was rubbed with cold water for
half an hour, followed by sitz-bath half an hour twice a day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="135"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135"></a></span></p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Bleeding at the Nose.</i>&mdash;Sprinkle the face with water, bandage
the back of the neck and the loins; shallow foot bath, where
obstinate. Bandage the genitals and change the bandage
often.</p>

<p>Dr. Gibbs states, that whilst at Gräfenberg, he was greatly
troubled with bleeding at the nose. He tried bandages at the
back of the neck and foot-bath to no purpose. Priessnitz
then ordered him two packing-sheets in succession, the first
fifteen minutes, the other twenty-five minutes, followed by
cold bath. This treatment had the desired effect.</p>

<p>I knew a case where a man bled profusely at the nose. He
put his feet up to the calves of his legs in cold water, and the
bleeding stopped in ten minutes.</p>

<p>A child had a blow on the nose, which occasioned it to bleed
frequently.</p>

<p>Bandage worn on the forehead for a week or two, and
foot baths, completed a cure.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Spitting Blood, Sickness, etc.</i>&mdash;This is sometimes occasioned
by piles. Sitz-baths (tepid 62°) may be taken; bandages
worn on the waist always, and on the chest at night. All
irritation should be avoided, and repose of body and mind
observed. Water ought to be drunk abundantly. Bleeding of
the lungs, the effect of pulmonary consumption, is not curable.
To distinguish the difference between cases requires the experience
of such a genius as Priessnitz.</p>


<h3>XLVI.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Small Pox, Measles, Hooping Cough, Croup,
Scarlatina, Colds, Shivering, etc.</span></h3>

<p>All these complaints form the easiest and surest part of
Priessnitz&rsquo;s practice. No child or adult ever died at Gräfenberg
of any of them. This fact, attested as it is by all writers
on Hydropathy, leads one to look on the incertitude of medical
practice in diseases incidental to children, with wonder and
dismay.</p>

<p>Priessnitz considers these complaints wholesome, being the
medium chosen by Nature for relieving the system.</p>

<p>On their appearance, his great aim is to strengthen the
patient, and eliminate the morbific matters by the pores of the
skin. It is frequently asked, <span class="pagenum" title="136"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136"></a></span>&ldquo;But does not the hydropathic
process drive the virus into the system?&rdquo; No, on the contrary,
the packing-sheet acts as a poultice to the whole body; and
this, followed by a tepid bath, causes an outward action, and
the system is cooled and relieved through miles of drainage
(the pores), the true medium through which relief can with
certainty be obtained.</p>

<p>A young man with measles, at Gräfenberg, had as many as
400 packing-sheets applied in about fourteen days.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Small-Pox.</i>&mdash;Small-pox, of all diseases, is that which should
be treated hydropathically; because by its operation the morbid
matters are thrown out by the pores of the skin, upon
which it rarely leaves any of those scars so detrimental to the
beauty of the person.</p>

<p>In the Water-cure, judiciously treated, the small-pox is under
no circumstances attended with danger, nor is the patient reduced
in strength as under any other treatment. &ldquo;Small pox,&rdquo;
Priessnitz says, &ldquo;instead of being suppressed, ought to be encouraged,
as it relieves the system of humours that ought to be
carried out of it, and is a healthy process.&rdquo; At one period the
profession were as much at fault in the treatment of small-pox,
as they now are in that of cholera. No means were left untried,
but they failed in arresting its ravages. Jenner&rsquo;s discovery
was hailed as an intervention of Providence, and he was
voted two grants in parliament. If Priessnitz is right, this
discovery may be hailed as a curse rather than a blessing. He
states that the insertion of poisonous matter into the blood of
a healthy subject produces poisonous consequences, is repugnant
to our feelings, and at variance with the laws of nature.</p>

<p>In small pox, where there is much eruption on the face, a
muslin handkerchief, wetted, may be used as a bandage to
the part.</p>

<p>If the head is much affected, head-bath and wet bandages
must be resorted to.</p>

<p>Bandage the back and thighs if they require it. In these
complaints, as in all others, if the bowels require opening, use
injections. Drink plentifully of water.</p>


<p class="mt15em">I treated a young lady in small-pox as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>First day&mdash;patient was confined to the sofa with head-ache
and general lassitude; next morning, fever and several pustules:<span class="pagenum" title="137"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137"></a></span>
two packing-sheets, the first twenty minutes, the other twenty-five
minutes; and tepid bath 70° for eight minutes. Afternoon&mdash;As
the packing-sheet did not heat so soon as that in the
morning, it was not changed, but patient remained in it an
hour and a quarter&mdash;the tepid bath eight minutes&mdash;drank sixteen
tumblers of water, windows always open. Second day,
eruption much increased over the body and face; treatment
as before. Third and fourth day, eruption increased; same
treatment persevered in. Fifth day, treatment only in the
morning. Sixth day, eruption decreasing. Eighth day, catamenia,
all treatment suspended; which it should be observed
would not have been the case had any fever remained. Tenth
day, patient out walking, eruption nearly gone. Twelfth and
thirteenth day, one rubbing-sheet on getting out of bed. It
should be stated, that the wet bandage was <i>perpetually</i> worn
during the treatment.</p>

<p>Patient quite as well and as strong as before the attack.
Complexion much clearer.</p>

<p>The most extraordinary thing to be observed is, that the
patient was not confined to bed for an hour&mdash;felt no disposition
to scratch herself. The tongue, after third day, was perfectly
clean, and her rest after the first night undisturbed.</p>

<p>The fever was taken out the first day, from which time she
was not inconvenienced in the least. This young lady had
been twice vaccinated.</p>

<p>The second and third day a smell remained in the room
after patient was taken out of the sheet and bath, that was perfectly
intolerable; which shows that the virus was taken out,
and accounts for the eruption being so mild.</p>

<p>Another friend of mine, 46 years of age, caught the small
pox, though he had been vaccinated twice. He was treated
much in the same way, and was out of doors quite well the
twelfth day, never having been confined to his bed for an hour.
Windows open night and day.</p>

<p>In all eruptive complaints, packing-sheets allay the fever.
To effect this, where the fever is strong, they should be changed
once or twice, or even oftener. When there is much eruption,
the heat of the bath which follows the wet sheet must be
increased in extraordinary cases even to 80 deg.</p>

<p>The packing-sheet process and the tepid bath must be used
twice a-day; patient must drink abundance of water; windows<span class="pagenum" title="138"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138"></a></span>
of the room ought to be always open; if constipated, clysters;
waist bandages in all cases.</p>

<p>This treatment persevered in, must cure all eruptive and other
fevers. No fear need exist as to the eruption by these means
being driven in&mdash;all experience shows it is the way to bring
it to the surface.</p>


<p class="mt15em">Dr. Farr declares himself a convert to the Water-cure in
cases of eruption and other fevers, and did me the favour of
writing the following letter:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss &mdash;&mdash; for two days had a sensation of languor, drowsiness,
and pain in the head and loins, with sickness and fever.
On the third day there appeared on the face small red spots,
and successively on the inferior parts, until the fifth day! these
rose into pimples, and then filled with puriform matter; dry
hard scales formed, and on these falling off, pits or marks were
left on some of them. The cold water cure had been commenced
when I first saw her, which had cut the fever, and
altered the character of the eruption; but as soon as the pustules
began to form, the nature of the disease was no longer a
matter of doubt; the pustules were as well developed, and went
through their regular changes as well and as perfectly as though
no application of cold had been made use of. This was the
first case of small-pox I saw this winter at Nice, but shortly
after several others occurred, and some of them of the confluent
kind. I must confess I was surprised at the complete success
of the cold water cure in this case.</p>

<p class="inrt">

&ldquo;Nice, 13th April, 1848.[&rdquo;]</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Scarlatina and Measles.</i>&mdash;These two complaints are treated
alike:&mdash;</p>

<p>Morning, packing-sheet twenty-five minutes, then change
it for another for twenty-five minutes, followed by tepid bath
64° for ten minutes. Bandages. If the eruption is extensive,
heat of the bath must be increased.</p>

<p>Repeat the treatment in the afternoon. If there is much
heat between the hours of treatment, take as many rubbing-sheets
one after the other as are necessary to subdue it. Much
water should be drunk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="139"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139"></a></span></p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Scarlatina.</i>&mdash;This complaint, on its first indication, is often
subdued by the following simple means:&mdash;</p>

<p>Two or three packing-sheets. Large bandage round the
waist. Drink water and walk out. A few hours afterwards
repeat the same.</p>

<p>If obstinate, two or three packing-sheets, changed when
warm, followed by tepid bath 64°.</p>

<p>If in scarlatina, or measles, the throat is affected, drink often
in small quantities. Renew the packing-sheet frequently.
When fever is diminished, slight perspiration in packing-sheet
for half an hour; then tepid bath twenty minutes, with
friction. Bread and milk diet.</p>


<p class="mt15em">A child, eleven years old, exhibited symptoms of scarlatina.
Dry and hot all over the body. Stitch from chest to back.
Was put into a tepid bath 64° and rubbed for an hour, cold
water being continually thrown over its shoulders; child extremely
cold; walked out. The same operation performed
again in the afternoon and twice the next day put an end to
the attack.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Hooping Cough.</i>&mdash;Rub the child well all over, particularly
the chest and back of the neck with hands continually dipped
in cold water; or use a rubbing sheet. Bandage the chest,
breast, and loins. If sufficiently strong, let the child lie in
bed until quite hot, then tepid bath 64° and use great friction
until quite chilled. If fever be present, a packing-sheet should
precede the tepid bath, and afterwards a bandage round the
waist.</p>


<p class="mt15em">Hooping cough may also be treated thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>Tepid bath, with great friction, for ten minutes in the morning;
two rubbing-sheets at mid-day; the same in the afternoon:
head-bath before going to bed; chest and body bandaged and
changed often; drink much water.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Mumps.</i>&mdash;Begin with rubbing-sheets; then packing-sheets
and tepid-bath.</p>

<p>Bandage the throat, loins, and side of the head affected.</p>

<p>Change the bandages often, keep the mouth full of water,
and change it when warm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="140"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140"></a></span></p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Croup with Sore Throat and Cough.</i>&mdash;A child, on awaking in
the morning, had face very red and found much difficulty in
breathing. Treatment:&mdash;</p>

<p>A cold water injection, then two rubbing-sheets, and bandage
all round the body from the throat to the hips.</p>

<p>An enema did not act, but appeared to cool the body; it
remained in the body eight minutes. When discharged,
another rubbing-sheet and wet bandage were applied. Breathing
free, and child slept until morning. Then well rubbed in
bath 62° for ten minutes.</p>

<p>Ate little breakfast. Dined on rice pudding.</p>

<p>Afternoon. Flushed and feverish.</p>

<p>Priessnitz, who now saw the patient, approved of what had
been done, and said if the croup had continued, eight or ten
rubbing-sheets ought to have been administered; allowing ten
to twenty minutes between each; depending upon the violence
of attack and strength of patient.</p>

<p>Evening. Patient was feverish, when the following was
ordered:&mdash;</p>

<p>Body, <i>but not</i> the feet, to be enveloped in packing-sheet, and
there remain until feet were warm: then tepid-bath 64°
ten minutes. If the feet are cold in the bath, rub them with
wet hands until a good circulation is produced.</p>

<p>In the night, fever abated and the child slept soundly.</p>

<p>Next day croup nearly gone and appetite good.</p>


<p class="mt15em">Another child with croup was treated in the same way on
the first day. At nine o&rsquo;clock at night, chest, windpipe,
and between the shoulders, were rubbed for some time with wet
hands; then the waist, throat, and chest were bandaged.</p>

<p>Slept well, but flushed and feverish in the morning;
complained of sore throat. Packing-sheet until hot, and
tepid-bath 64°.</p>

<p>Still feverish.</p>

<p>At noon, rubbing-sheet, not wrung out. If no fever and
appetite, to go out.</p>

<p>Repeat rubbing-sheet in the afternoon.</p>

<p>Should fever continue, packing-sheet followed by rubbing-sheets.
This was not necessary.</p>

<p>Second day. Tepid bath in the morning, and rubbing-sheets
at twelve and five o&rsquo;clock. Both children cured in three days.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="141"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141"></a></span></p>


<p class="mt15em">A child seven years old, subject all his life to severe attacks
of croup, on being seized with one at Gräfenberg, was treated
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Rubbed between the shoulders, and on the chest, for some
minutes with wet hands; then lifted out of bed, and well rubbed
all over, especially in the legs, in a very wet sheet from
five to eight minutes.</p>

<p>A wet handkerchief was then put on as a shawl, and a bandage
round the waist; when the patient was allowed to return
to bed for ten minutes; after which the same treatment was
repeated. This induced sleep, and he awoke free from all signs
of croup.</p>

<p>At twelve o&rsquo;clock there was a relapse, when the rubbing was
renewed, and bandage applied to the waist.</p>

<p>At five o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon, tepid-bath 64° for some
minutes, and patient slept all night in bandage and wet shawl.</p>

<p>The treatment was renewed second day.</p>


<p class="mt15em">A child three years old, also liable to attacks of croup, on
being attacked one evening about nine o&rsquo;clock, was instantly
rubbed on the chest, windpipe, and between the shoulders,
followed by a general rubbing in rubbing-sheet for five minutes;
then bandages were applied to throat, chest, and round the
waist.</p>

<p>This apparently gave great relief, but in the morning
he awoke flushed and feverish, complaining of his throat. A
rubbing-sheet followed by a tepid-bath for some minutes, was
resorted to; and at twelve o&rsquo;clock another rubbing-sheet
followed. Fever having subsided, he was allowed to go out.</p>

<p>At five o&rsquo;clock the rubbing-sheet was repeated. He wore
the bandage on his throat down to his chest day and night,
changing it when dry. Had fever continued, he was to have
lain in packing-sheet at five o&rsquo;clock until warm, instead of the
rubbing-sheet. Since this time both children have been
perfectly well.&mdash;<i>August, 1845.</i></p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Ophthalmia.</i>&mdash;Inflammation of the eyes is generally catarrhal
or rheumatic, and requires the same treatment as rheumatism
and gout. I never saw it acute, but always chronic.</p>

<p>To the rheumatic treatment, Priessnitz adds eye-baths, and
the douche. The latter must be received in the joined hands;<span class="pagenum" title="142"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142"></a></span>
from which, water coming from a height will rebound as high
as the eyes. Head-baths are equally indispensable, as well as
fomentations, to these organs. Chronic ophthalmia, even at
Gräfenberg, is most obstinate, and requires a long course of
treatment.</p>


<p class="mt15em">A captain thus attacked, felt, after several head-baths which
he continued for three quarters of an hour, a pungent pain in
the head, accompanied by swelling of the ears. An abscess
was expected in one of these organs, when the pain gave way
to a virulent deposit, formed in the thick part of the cheek;
after this, the eyes were re-established.</p>


<p class="mt15em">Another sufferer came to Gräfenberg, with an exfoliation in
the corner of the eye. To the whole of the treatment, Priessnitz
added eye-baths; after each of which, the invalid was to
look fixedly at the light, and immediately re-plunge the eyes
into cold water. This man, who was perfectly blind on coming,
was, on leaving Gräfenberg, able to read with spectacles.</p>


<p class="mt15em">A third patient presented a very remarkable case of blindness,
the result of a cold caught during hunting, by which
he lost his sight. He had been nine months blind, when he
arrived at Gräfenberg; after each process of perspiration, which
he submitted to twice a day, the bath and the head-bath,
matter mixed with blood came from the eyes. One might
say that some pounds exuded from the eyes in the course of
three weeks. I did not see the termination of this cure, before
leaving Gräfenberg; but I can affirm, that the last time I spoke
to the invalid, he could distinguish colours, and also objects
at a certain distance.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Itch and Ringworm.</i>&mdash;These diseases are more easily cured
by cold water, than by any other means. The process of
perspiration in the wet sheet, leads to success; but ringworm
is frequently more difficult to cure than the itch. It requires
longer time, and a more energetic use of cold water.&mdash;The
douche is also indispensable in cases of ringworm, in order to
bring the morbid humours to the skin. The most difficult
ringworms to cure, are those which have been driven in by
bad treatment. This disease is really equal to the gout, in
point of obstinacy, for it re-appears upon the skin after the use<span class="pagenum" title="143"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143"></a></span>
of the douche a long time. After the process of perspiration,
and cold baths too, it again shows itself under forms much
more serious in their aspect, than in the beginning.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Cold, Cough, with Inflammation.</i>&mdash;A lady was ordered&mdash;</p>

<p>Packing-sheet, half or three quarters of an hour, then tepid
bath 64° for an hour, twice a day. After first day much
better. Third day cured. If patient is fatigued by staying
in bath so long, let him come out and walk about the room for
a few minutes, then enter the bath again.</p>


<p class="mt15em">Major&mdash;&mdash;, a strong man, pursued the following treatment
and was cured the third day.</p>

<p>Morning&mdash;Packing-sheet, two and a half hours, and tepid
bath 64°, ten minutes. Took a long walk.</p>

<p>At noon&mdash;Packing-sheet, one hour, and bath ten minutes.</p>

<p>Afternoon&mdash;The same.</p>

<p>Bandaged throat and chest day and night.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Chronic Sore Throat.</i>&mdash;Child two and a half years old.
Morning&mdash;Packing-sheet one hour and then cold bath; noon,
tepid sitz-bath, fifteen minutes. Bandage round the throat at
night, but not by day; rub the throat often with wet hands.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Sore Throat, Pain in the Limbs, and Prostration of Strength.</i>&mdash;A
young lady so attacked was ordered not to eat any dinner
that day; to run up and down stairs and about the room
until warm.</p>

<p>Then a blanket, warmed by the fire and the patient enveloped
in it, covered by many others, patient to keep in movement
in the blanket the first quarter of an hour, to promote
perspiration (the sweating process). Bandage throat, chest,
and waist. Hold water in the mouth, and rub the throat
often with wet hands (requisites in all cases where the throat
is engaged). Patient being under the general treatment at the
usual time, packing sheet and tepid bath, etc., were used.</p>

<p>Cure effected the second day.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Cold and Cough.</i>&mdash;A child six years old. Tepid bath 64°
twice a day, fifteen minutes each time, and waist bandage.
Cured the second day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="144"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144"></a></span></p>

<p>For an adult the above is also good treatment, with the
addition of holding water constantly in the mouth when
walking, and wearing bandages on chest and legs up to the
fork at night; morning, two rubbing sheets; the same at mid-day
and in the afternoon. Two foot-baths during the day of
ten minutes each; feet to be rubbed well the whole time. Bandages
as in former case.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Cold, and Sore Throat.</i>&mdash;Bandage the throat at night, expose
it by day, even in winter.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i><ins title="Transcriber's Note: Paragraph appears to be out of context &ndash; see p. 124">Pain in the Bowels</ins></i>.&mdash;Packing-sheet until hot, then tepid
bath 66° morning and afternoon; at mid-day, sitz-bath 64°
twenty minutes. It was truly astonishing to witness the result
of one day&rsquo;s treatment.</p>


<p class="mt15em">In a case of great swelling in the throat, bandages were
applied to it always, and changed every twenty minutes. To
this were added rubbing-sheets three times a day, and a sitz-bath
64° for twenty minutes.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Cold.</i>&mdash;In a severe cold, suspend packing-sheet in the
morning and substitute rubbing sheet; at noon, packing-sheet
for an hour, followed by tepid-bath 64°.</p>

<p>If not soon well, sweating process for an hour and half,
followed by tepid bath 64°.</p>

<p>In a common cold, Priessnitz ordered three rubbing-sheets,
with great friction, on going to bed. For children, he finds
a tepid bath, for ten minutes twice a day, is sufficient; dining
on farinaceous food and going out as usual.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Cold with Head Ache.</i>&mdash;Two rubbing-sheets and tepid sitz-bath
for twenty minutes before dinner, and the same in the
afternoon. After each operation a cold-head bath for ten
minutes.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Cold, Sore Throat, and enlarged Tonsils.</i>&mdash;Packing-sheets and
tepid-bath twice a day. Tepid sitz-bath and bandages are
generally ordered.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Cold settled in the Knee.</i>&mdash;One day rising from kneeling,<span class="pagenum" title="145"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145"></a></span>
a patient, aged 50, felt great pain in her knee, which swelled so
as to prevent her going out. Despite medical skill, it increased
in size, and the foot lost all sensation; this took place twelve
months previous to going to Gräfenberg.</p>

<p>The patient for the first seven or eight weeks was confined
entirely to her room. In the morning, packing-sheet and tepid
bath; noon, stood on the leg up to the top of the thigh in
cold water half an hour; afternoon, repeated the same; drank
ten glasses of water daily; and kept the leg and foot constantly
bandaged. At length she began to walk with two sticks; then
she took a cold bath in the morning, and after ten weeks the
douche twice a day, ten minutes each time. Digestion good.</p>

<p>The bone resumed its position and the swelling began to
diminish; when, the foot having gained its action, she could
walk with a stick without other assistance. This lady was an
excellent example of the benefit of the Water-cure.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Cough, Sore Throat, and pain in the Chest.</i>&mdash;Heating
bandage to the throat at night; expose it by day.</p>

<p>Morning, packing-sheet until quite hot; then tepid bath
64° for fifteen minutes twice a day.</p>

<p>In the middle of the day tepid sitz-bath, twenty minutes. It
was astonishing to witness the change for the better, after
the first day&rsquo;s treatment.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Cold and Cough.</i>&mdash;An infant aged six years. Tepid bath
64° twice a day, for fifteen minutes each time.</p>

<p>Heating bandage round the waist. Cured in two days.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Severe Swelling in the Throat.</i>&mdash;A gentleman resident in my
house was ordered three rubbing-sheets, three times a day,
and bandages, changed every twenty minutes.</p>

<p>A friend of mine was constantly annoyed by relaxed and
sore throat, without any assignable cause. At length it was
found that he slept with his mouth open. An Indian-rubber
band to go under the chin and over the head, so as to keep
his mouth shut was used at nights and from that time he was
no more annoyed with the complaint.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Flatulency.</i>&mdash;Injection and sitz-baths.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="146"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146"></a></span></p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Drowsiness.</i>&mdash;Foot-bath, and rub the head with wet hands.
If these means are not sufficient, use the packing-sheet, followed
by friction in tepid bath for an hour.</p>

<p>A patient complaining to Priessnitz of feeling heavy in the
head after dinner, was ordered to pour a bottle of water on his
head, and take head-baths occasionally.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Hysteria.</i>&mdash;Rubbing-sheets every five minutes, until every
appearance of hysteria is gone. The patient should lie in bed
between each packing-sheet to get warm.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Ague.</i>&mdash;Tepid bath 62° with great friction until fever is
reduced; then packing-sheets, changed on becoming warm;
followed by tepid bath, bandage, drinking water, etc. The
sweating stage is much relieved by packing-sheets.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Shivering.</i>&mdash;For a shivering fit, a patient was ordered five
rubbing-sheets, with an interval of five minutes between them&mdash;patient
to walk about the room during that time: first application
effected a cure.</p>

<p>A young lady strong and robust, always cold, sleepy, and indisposed
to leave the house, was ordered to use the packing-sheet
until warm; then a tepid bath for an hour and upwards,
three times a day. In three days she was perfectly well.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Weakness of Chest and Short Breathing.</i>&mdash;A delicate lady was
ordered two packing-sheets, from the arm-pits to knees, and
tepid bath 64°. Feet being cold were rubbed in shallow foot-bath
for a quarter of an hour, then dried, and she walked
about her chamber for a quarter of an hour before going to
bed.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Itching of the Fingers, like the approach of Chilblains.</i>&mdash;Wash
hands in tepid water, 64°, three times a day for five
minutes; wear heating-bandage from the wrist to the elbow.</p>


<h3>XLVII.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Sore Mouth&mdash;Inflamed Gums.</span></h3>

<p>For this complaint, sweating twice a day, long tepid baths,
head-baths, and sitz-baths, were ordered. Tepid water, 68°,
should be held in the mouth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="147"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147"></a></span></p>


<h3>XLVIII.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Tooth-ache, Preservation of the
Teeth, etc.</span></h3>

<p>If the tooth is unsound, it must be stopped or extracted.
Sometimes when a tooth is plugged, the pressure on the
nerve renders it insupportable. At Geneva, a clever dentist
avoided this painful result by first cleaning out the tooth,
then placing a small plate of metal very flat and thin as
a sort of shelf in the tooth, so as to leave a hollow below it.
By this means, he avoided the pressure upon the nerve, and
the stopping was not felt. This is foreign to our purpose; but
I insert it as a useful hint. In ordinary cases of tooth-ache, or
inflammation of the gums, fill the mouth with warm water;
then with the hand dipped frequently in cold water, rub the
cheeks until it can be borne no longer; then rub the gums
even to bleeding, and bandage the face: if pain returns in the
night, repeat the rubbing. Long and often-repeated tepid
foot-baths are also useful.</p>

<p>A patient at Gräfenberg writes as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;Priessnitz ordered
me, for tooth-ache and pain in my gums, to rub the back
of my head and down my neck often and for a long time. The
first application afforded me relief. After ten or fifteen minutes&rsquo;
rubbing, the pain would leave for hours, and then return. Soon
there was a longer interval between the attacks: at last, the
pain ceased altogether.&rdquo; The theory of this mode of curing
such an ailment is based upon true philosophical principles.
Who does not know that the nerves of the teeth centre in the
back of the head? It is evident, then, that by friction to that
part, the inflammation will be drawn from the gums.</p>

<p>A friend of mine, suffering intensely from pain in the gums,
found relief from a tepid sitz-bath of thirty minutes. As a
preservative for the teeth, there is nothing like water. It is
related in a useful little pamphlet, entitled &ldquo;Facts, proving
Water to be the only beverage fitted to give health and Strength
to Man,&rdquo; that General Norton, the Mohawk Chief, who was in
this country some years ago, said that when the Indians are in
their own settlements, living upon the produce of the chase, and
drinking water, their teeth always look clean and white; but
when they go into the United States, and get spirituous liquors,
their teeth look dirty and yellow, and then they are frequently<span class="pagenum" title="148"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148"></a></span>
afflicted with tooth-ache, and are obliged to have their teeth
drawn. For cleaning the teeth and preserving them, there is
nothing so good as cold water; warm or tepid water exposes
us to catch cold in the gums, whilst those who are in the
constant habit of using cold water are seldom troubled in this
way.</p>


<h3>XLIX.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Watery or Inflamed Eyes.</span></h3>

<p>For watery eyes, an eye-bath three times a day for five minutes
will draw blood to, and strengthen, them. For inflamed eyes,
throw water with the hand into them three times a day for five
minutes each time, and wear a bandage on the forehead at
night.</p>


<p><i>Sore Eyes.</i>&mdash;Place the back part of the head in cold water
three times a day, ten minutes each time; then use an eye-bath
for five minutes, twice a day: for this purpose, glasses are
to be procured of the form of the eye. After the eyes are closed
in the water for about a minute, they should be opened for the
other four minutes. At night, a bandage should be placed at
the back of the neck: this and the head-bath have the effect of
drawing inflammation from the front. In most cases, foot-baths
twice a day are beneficial. Where there is great inflammation;
a very wet bandage may be applied to the eyes for an hour
occasionally. As a preservative to the eyes, open them in the
wash-hand basin of a morning for two minutes, or throw water
[i]nto them occasionally, for two or three minutes at a time.</p>


<h3>L.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Deafness.</span></h3>

<p>Rubbing-Sheet three times a day, wear bandage over the
ears at night, and drink plentifully of water; tepid sitz-baths.
This treatment will often relieve deafness: where it is
ineffectual, the general treatment must be resorted to.</p>


<h3>LI.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ear-Ache.</span></h3>

<p>Linen wetted should be introduced into the ear; all round the
ear often rubbed with wet hands for a quarter of an hour each
time, and a bandage worn round the head; also tepid foot-bath
for half an hour.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="149"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149"></a></span></p>
<p>In obstinate cases, perspiration and tepid baths, sitz and
foot-baths, must be resorted to. For an obstinate pain in the
ear in a strong man, two packing-sheets and tepid bath for two
hours were prescribed; next day, sweating for five or six hours,
and cold bath.</p>


<h3>LII.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ringworm, Itch, etc.</span></h3>

<p>These diseases are more easily conquered by Hydropathy than
by any other means. The most difficult ringworms to cure, are
those driven in by bad treatment. This disease is equal to
gout in obstinacy. We shall here warn the sufferer that the
diet prescribed must be rigorously observed. Dr. Munde states
that &ldquo;three men, attacked with this disease, arrived at Gräfenberg,
at the same time as himself; the first, following the
treatment with energy for two months, returned home resolved
to continue through the winter, and then return to Gräfenberg
to finish the cure, which, at the time of his departure, was
more than half effected. The two others remained at Gräfenberg,
one for eight months, the other six; both left radically
cured. The treatment of one of these cases was attended by an
acidity in the throat, and by the vomiting of matter containing
chalky substances. The acidity of the throat was such, that it
caused the tongue to be ulcerated.[&rdquo;]</p>


<h3>LIII.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Psoriasis.</span></h3>

<p>The following extraordinary case is as stated by the patient,
an English gentleman, himself. An eruption made its appearance
on his head when twenty-three years of age; cause
unknown. Underwent medical treatment six years, and tried
every remedy five physicians could suggest. Thrice salivated,
tried all sorts of ointments, some so powerful as to burn the
flesh. Visited Harrowgate the third time, when the eruption
spread all over his body. Stomach and bowels a continual
source of annoyance. Arrived at Gräfenberg 27th July, 1843;
next morning, went into tepid, from that to cold, and back to
tepid bath; and afterwards pursued the following treatment:&mdash;</p>

<p>Morning, two packing-sheets, the first for a quarter of an
hour, the second for an hour, followed by tepid bath for half a
minute, then cold, and back to tepid bath; noon, packing-<span class="pagenum" title="150"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150"></a></span>sheet
one hour, and rubbing-sheet; afternoon, packing-sheet
one hour, and rubbing-sheet. At the expiration of first bath,
the bowels acted regularly. Morning and afternoon treatment
the same; noon, douche three minutes, and sitz-bath half an
hour.</p>

<p>Sept. 5.&mdash;Considerable pain felt in thighs and legs; ordered
after douching to walk a few minutes, with legs exposed to the
air.</p>

<p>Sept. 20.&mdash;Diarrh&oelig;a. For this, the patient was put into
packing-sheet doubled, from the arm-pits to the hips till warm;
this was renewed seven times every quarter of an hour. Patient
free from pain, but weak. Cramp returned in the evening,
when a tepid sitz-bath was ordered, if that did not succeed, a
clyster was to be administered.</p>

<p>The sitz-bath removed the pain. About this time pain in
his side, which patient had felt from his youth, left him and
has not returned. Patient observed that the smell of the
packing-sheets, after his having lain in them, was offensive.
Eruption at this time evidently worse. Third month, packing-sheet
and cold bath instead of tepid bath, and in the afternoon
cold bath instead of rubbing-sheet.</p>

<p>Reaction after every operation improved. Eruption so bad
that skin cracked in various places, and discharged yellow
gummy matter.</p>

<p>Fourth month.&mdash;Eruption caused head to feel quite sore;
wore bandage to head and changed it four times a day.</p>

<p>Fifth month.&mdash;Rheumatic pains in shoulder, which had
been felt at intervals for years. Rubbed well on coming out
of cold bath; pain ceased in eight or ten days. After some
time the pain returned again in both shoulders; this was subdued
by rubbing-sheets as follows:&mdash;three the same night on
going to bed; next day at noon, four afternoon, packing-sheet,
followed by three rubbing-sheets, and on going to bed
five more. Never felt rheumatic pain since. Eruption worse,
covering the entire surface of head and ears, and spots on the
body as before.</p>

<p>Jan. 8.&mdash;Ceased sweating from weakness; eruption improved
in appearance.</p>

<p>Seventh month.&mdash;Commenced sweating again; eruption
improved.</p>

<p>Eighth month.&mdash;Eruption still improving, leaving the skin<span class="pagenum" title="151"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151"></a></span>
inflamed and contracted; the spot on left leg gone, and lumps
on neck decreasing in size.</p>

<p>Ninth month.&mdash;Head and ears better, left off venturing to
expose them to the air; washed them frequently with cold
water; eruption began to peel off when rubbed. Towards the
end of the month, body quite free from all eruption. Patient
winds up by saying, &ldquo;I have gradually left off the various
operations, preparatory to my departure, and am happy to say,
that now every particle and sign of the eruption has disappeared.&rdquo;</p>

<p>June 17, 1844.&mdash;In a letter written some time afterwards to
a friend, he stated that he was perfectly cured of the disease.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Fistula.</i>&mdash;Patient three years previously had been cured of
stricture, to the treatment for which he attributes his present
complaint. Morning, packing-sheet till warm, and cold bath;
noon, rubbing-sheet and tepid sitz-bath ten minutes; afternoon,
packing-sheet and cold bath. Bandages to the fork and arms,
and round the waist always.</p>

<p>In three months, douche for three or four minutes. Sitz-bath
to be cold instead of tepid, and alternate days foot-bath
and tepid half bath, without rubbing-sheet. Cured in five
months.</p>

<p>In three months, douche for three or four months; sitz-bath
to be cold instead of tepid; and alternate days foot-bath
and tepid half bath, without rubbing-sheet. Cured in five
months.</p>


<p class="mt15em">Another patient stated that, he suffered from piles; for these
he was drugged and leeched at the anus; treatment which was
no doubt the cause of the fistula.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Nose Frost-bitten.</i>&mdash;Chafe it with tepid-water 62°, and wear
bandage continually.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Leprosy.</i>&mdash;Patient ordered three packing-sheets and tepid-baths
daily, wet linen drawers and waistcoat, with dry ones
over them at night. Another patient wore two pairs of wet
drawers for the same disease by day.</p>

<p>In another case, patient was ordered packing-sheets and
long cold baths, and slept in a wet dress that fitted him, with<span class="pagenum" title="152"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152"></a></span>
a dry one over it; the whole being covered with a thick
blanket. The patient described that his dress very soon
became dry, whilst the blanket was wet and he was cold. To
obviate this, Priessnitz told him to put on a second blanket,
and in two hours take it off.</p>


<h3>LIV.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Fistula.</span></h3>

<p>Where parties are otherwise in tolerable health, this complaint
is always curable in about eight or nine months. When health
is established, contractility takes place. In cases where patients
have been long under medical treatment, the cure of fistula
requires great patience and perseverance.</p>

<p>Morning, packing-sheet and bath; noon, rubbing-sheet,
douche; afternoon, four o&rsquo;clock, douche; five o&rsquo;clock, packing-sheet
and bath.</p>

<p>Bandage to waist and part affected. The latter made of old
linen.</p>

<p>Cold food is better for this complaint than hot. No sitz-baths.</p>


<h3>LV.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Hæmorrhage, Irregular Menstruation,
Pains in the Womb, &amp;c.</span></h3>

<p>All these diseases are successfully combated by hydropathy.</p>

<p>Away from Priessnitz, excessive menstruation requires
cautious treatment. Persons so afflicted may, however, adopt
the following means of relief.</p>

<p>At the period, wear a large bandage round the waist, wash
the body with cold water on rising in the morning.</p>

<p>Drink plentifully of cold water.</p>

<p>When discharge has ceased, use a sitz-bath for fifteen minutes,
once or twice a day.</p>

<p>If patient is very ill she must remain in bed lightly covered,
wearing a very broad bandage, which must be changed every
five minutes, or at most, every ten minutes, until better.</p>

<p>In cases of flooding, equally broad bandage, very wet, and
changed often; also bandage the calves of the legs, and change
it every five or ten minutes.</p>

<p>In case of great weakness, a tepid bath of 64° for eight or
ten minutes, with much friction, must be resorted to, fresh
water being constantly added, and fresh air admitted into the
room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="153"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153"></a></span></p>

<p>At the period when menstruation is coming on, if in great
pain, let the abdomen, feet, and legs, be well rubbed for a long
time by hands dipped often in cold water.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Too frequent Menstruation.</i>&mdash;This frequently arises from
weakness; in that case, the general treatment to fortify the
system is requisite.</p>

<p>Three rubbing-sheets a day, drink plentifully of cold water,
eat everything cold.</p>

<p>On rising in the morning, wash internal parts well with a
sponge. If this is not sufficient, add packing-sheet and cold
bath in the morning, and during the week, take two tepid sitz-baths
fifteen minutes, 62°, rubbing the abdomen all the time.
Change waist bandage often.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Irregular Menstruation.</i>&mdash;A lady, apparently in good health,
came to Gräfenberg in 1840. She suffered greatly from head-aches,
occasioned by irregular menstruation; when she arrived,
though catamenia was strong, she was ordered a sitz-bath, when
it ceased and returned in fourteen days. During the patient&rsquo;s
stay, it returned three times, notwithstanding which the treatment
was continued.</p>

<p>Sweating morning and evening two hours, followed by first
tepid and then cold bath.</p>

<p>During the day two tepid sitz-baths, followed immediately
by tepid foot-baths, fifteen minutes each.</p>

<p>Douche three minutes. Head-bath, five minutes each side,
making fifteen minutes.</p>

<p>Ten to twelve glasses of water, used waist bandages, and took
much exercise. <i>Cured in six weeks.</i></p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Suppressed Menstruation.</i>&mdash;When catamenia comes on, except
in extraordinary cases, all the operations of the Water-cure are
suspended, but when patients are in a crisis or fever, they are
continued. When menstruation, from any cause, is suppressed,
the following treatment is prescribed.</p>

<p>Three or four times a day, three or four rubbing-sheets, not
much wrung out, with great friction. These are each time to
be followed by tepid foot-baths of fifteen minutes each.</p>

<p>A lady at Gräfenberg, for this complaint, took packing-sheet
and tepid bath in the morning, four rubbing-sheets at noon,<span class="pagenum" title="154"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154"></a></span>
four in the afternoon, and four at night; between each rubbing-sheet,
she walked or ran naked about the room, with the
windows open, though in the depth of a Silesian winter. This
treatment brought on catemenia the third day. No bandage
was used. If blood had gone to the head, then foot-baths were
to have been applied, and the feet and legs rubbed with hands
dipped in water the whole time. If these means had failed,
then the sitz-bath and douche were to have been added to the
treatment. After every operation, patient must go out of doors
and take much exercise, and drink not less than twelve glasses
of water a day. In some cases, cold foot-baths are more active
than tepid ones; and in obstinate complaints of this kind, the
sweating process is useful.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Pains in the Womb.</i>&mdash;Tepid sitz-bath from forty minutes to
an hour, rubbing the abdomen well whilst in the bath with
wet hands. Sweating in cold weather beneficial; in hot weather
the contrary. To effect a cure, the general health must be
established.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Hæmorrhage, Irregular Menstruation, &amp;c.</i>&mdash;A patient aged 42,
was cured of hæmorrhage in six minutes.</p>

<p>Packing-sheet followed by rubbing-sheet, were first resorted
to. After three weeks it became necessary to increase the
packing-sheets to fifty a day. They were applied from the
arm-pits down to the hips. Patient kept in a perfect state of
repose.</p>

<p>In five days this treatment stopped the hæmorrhage; then
packing-sheets and cold baths twice a day, were had recourse
to, until patient was cured. No sitz-baths. Large bandage,
often renewed, was always worn round the waist.</p>

<p>An English lady of title, nearly exhausted from violent
hæmorrhage, arrived at Gräfenberg in October. She was ordered
not to put her foot to the ground for two months, to sleep
with her window open, and to be covered with one sheet only.
After the packing-sheets, she was carried to the cold bath and
back to bed. She felt as in an ice-house. In two months,
great improvement: then, though winter, and the ground was
covered with snow, she was ordered to go out without bonnet
or umbrella, and as lightly clad as possible; and to douche
twice a day for ten minutes. Everything being done to cause<span class="pagenum" title="155"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155"></a></span>
contraction. In May she was declared perfectly cured. The
husband, on coming to her, was in ecstasies at her healthy
appearance, and was at a loss to find words to express his
gratitude to Priessnitz.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Head-ache, Pain in the Limbs, and great uneasiness.</i>&mdash;A child
taken in the night with the above symptoms accompanied with
fever, was ordered immediately&mdash;</p>

<p>Rubbing-sheet, sitz-bath, and head-bath; at noon, rubbing-sheet
and sitz-bath; afternoon, packing-sheet twenty minutes,
and tepid-bath.</p>

<p>If the packing-sheet heated soon, then to be changed for
twenty minutes.</p>

<p>If symptoms continued, renew the rubbing-sheets, sitz, and
head-baths, in the night.</p>

<p>Patient well in the afternoon.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Pain in the Breast.</i>&mdash;A lady, two days after her confinement,
had her breast hardened by milk, so that she could not endure
the infant&rsquo;s attempt to draw it. She applied the bandage,
covered with a dry one; it was immediately soothing, and in
less than an hour, the milk began to flow.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>The Whites.</i>&mdash;These find a certain cure in hydropathy.
Very often sitz-bath, beginning with tepid water and afterwards
using cold and injections, effect the object. When they do
not, rubbing sheet and the douche are resorted to.</p>

<p>A case within my knowledge was cured by the following
treatment:</p>

<p>Three tepid sitz-baths 60° daily; morning, two packing sheets;
one fifteen minutes, the other twenty-five minutes, followed
by cold bath, with cold water thrown over the body; afternoon,
the sheets were repeated, and either a rubbing sheet or cold
bath. When patient did not feel well the tepid bath was used.
Body bandage worn always.</p>


<h3>LVI.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Change of Life in Females.</span></h3>

<p>Health would be re-established by a few months&rsquo; treatment&mdash;such
as rubbing-sheets and douche; drinking water and
wearing the bandage. Those who cannot <i>devote time</i> to go to<span class="pagenum" title="156"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156"></a></span>
Gräfenberg, should take a rubbing sheet every morning, wear
a waist bandage, and drink seven or eight tumblers of water
a-day.</p>


<h3>LVII.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Treatment of Ladies.</span></h3>

<p><i>Pain at the Chest, Dry Cough, Weak Digestion, Pain and
Pressure at the Nape of the Neck, Cold Feet, Great Emaciation
and Suppression of Catemenia for three months, Skin dry and
hard, Unable to Walk.</i>&mdash;A lady, 38 years of age, for the above
symptoms, was treated as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Morning, packing-sheet and tepid-bath; noon, rubbing-sheet;
afternoon, as in the morning.</p>

<p>Bandages on chest and abdomen day and night.</p>

<p>Ten glasses of water drank daily.</p>

<p>In ten days able to walk a little, cough eased, better spirits.</p>

<p>In a month, skin softer; and shortly after, a cold plunge-bath
was ordered instead of tepid.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Accouchement.</i>&mdash;Experience has demonstrated the utility of
cold ablutions, sitz-baths, simple diet, and exercise in the air,
to females enceinte; water should be substituted for all stimulants.
Madame Priessnitz, for her easy and prompt accouchements,
is indebted to cold water and sitz-baths, which she took
daily for six weeks previous.</p>

<p>The following statement to me in writing, by an American
gentleman, shews the value that ought to be set on hydropathy
by ladies.</p>


<p>&ldquo;From 1837 to 1844 inclusive, Mrs. &mdash;&mdash; was, to all appearance,
very healthy, but had an abortive accouchement every
year, sometimes twice a year. After the second accident of this
nature, she took advice; when, on one occasion, she was
subjected to depletion; another, she was advised to pass her
time entirely in a recumbent position; she had the best advice
that could be procured in Boston, Florence, and Liverpool.
These mishaps caused her many distressing and alarming symptoms.
She now went to a hydropathic establishment for a
few weeks, and derived great benefit from the treatment; this
determined her on going to Gräfenberg, when Priessnitz
assured her, if confined there, no doubt need be entertained of
a favourable result, or the life of the infant. In April, 1845,<span class="pagenum" title="157"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157"></a></span>
she arrived at Gräfenberg; after six weeks she became unwell,
and continued so for some time; she, however, persevered in
the full treatment until April, 1846, when she gave birth to a
male child weighing twelve pounds, six ounces.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Her treatment had been packing-sheet and cold bath in the
morning, rubbing-sheets, douche, and sitz-baths in the after
part of the day, all the winter. The latter she took the very
morning of her accouchement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;During labour, the bandages round the waist were quite
wet, and changed every ten minutes. She was also ordered to
walk and use her arms as much as possible.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After the birth, she was washed twice a day with tepid
water <ins title="Transcriber's Note: probably Reaumur scale">15°</ins>, with wet towels.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The child, immediately on entering the world, was put into
water as it came from the fountain; afterwards warm water
was mixed with it until it reached 15°. The child&rsquo;s baths were
afterwards tepid 15°, and gradually reduced to 12°. After two
months he had two of these baths a day.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In case of pain in the bowels bandages were applied; if not
attended with immediate relief, a cold clyster. He is now
three years old, strong and cheerful; his mother free from all
those symptoms hitherto so obstinate, mysterious, and apparently
fatal. I leave Gräfenberg with the highest sense of
gratitude towards the wonderful man, whose intuitive genius
has proved such a blessing to thousands. I regard hydropathy
a thousand times more as a science of life than a remedial
agent. I have seen enough to convince me that he who lives
according to its precepts, <i>must</i>, barring accidents and pestilence,
live to a good old age; it will teach all to make their passions
harmonise with their organisation, and then it will be, not only
a medicine, but a religion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If fever of any kind supervenes upon accouchements, wet
sheets and tepid-baths are resorted to.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Pregnancy.</i>&mdash;A delicate lady, who accompanied her husband
to Gräfenberg, became in the family-way; she had long suffered
from derangement of the stomach, which now became much
worse: she wasted away and became weakly.</p>

<p>Ordered two rubbing-sheets daily, one in the morning, the
other in the afternoon. A sitz-bath occasionally.</p>

<p>Bandage round the waist, always drank plentifully of water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="158"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158"></a></span></p>

<p>Under this treatment, she became stout and plump. She
walked until the day before her accouchement. When she
felt the pains of labour coming on, Priessnitz caused her to sit
up until the last moment, with a bandage round the abdomen,
which, during labour, was changed every six minutes. The
delivery was quick and easy.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Experience shews</i> the utility of cold ablutions and exercise
in the open air, to females who are in the family-way. To this
add simple diet, and drinking plentifully of cold water. All
stimulants should be avoided. A sitz-bath occasionally, and a
bandage when sensations of pain are felt, will also be beneficial.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Sterility.</i>&mdash;I could enumerate instances out of number, of
parties (who had often deplored the absence of children) having
families, after undergoing the cleansing and fortifying process
of the Water-cure.</p>

<p>A gentleman, now an M.P., and his lady, were travelling for
their health in Italy. A friend of mine at Venice, advised them
to go to Gräfenberg. They did so, and after five months, the lady
became enceinte. She wrote afterwards, that she had been
married eleven years without having had a child; that since
her trip to Gräfenberg she had three. Her meeting with that
gentleman at Venice, she said she looked upon as an act of
divine Providence.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Difficulty in passing Urine.</i>&mdash;Wash the parts with cold water
often; the body twice a-day; bandage the parts; drink plentifully
of water and eat grapes.</p>


<h3>LVIII.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Giddiness, Dizziness, etc.</span></h3>

<p>Bandage (wet) round the head; lie in bed and change body-bandage
often. Tepid sitz-bath 62° for forty minutes. If after
a few hours, patient is not better, resort to packing-sheet and
tepid bath; or three or four rubbing-sheets twice or thrice a-day,
followed by tepid foot-baths.</p>


<h3>LIX.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Head-Aches.</span></h3>

<p>When they proceed from nervousness, rubbing-sheet for three
or four minutes, well wetting the head first, followed by<span class="pagenum" title="159"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159"></a></span>
sitz-bath for fifteen minutes. When these fail, resort to packing-sheet
and tepid bath. Head-bandage.</p>

<p>It frequently happens that well washing the head, rubbing
the temples for a long time with wet hands, and wearing a wet
bandage as a turban, the head-ache is relieved.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Head-ache and Flushing from anxiety.</i>&mdash;A lad was ordered:</p>

<p>Foot-bath twenty minutes; feet very much rubbed during
that time. Body bandaged and bandage often changed.</p>

<p>Tepid sitz-bath 62° quarter of an hour; head-bath for ten
minutes, and afterwards bandage round it very often terminates
head-ache at once.</p>

<p>When head-ache is obstinate, the duration of the sitz-bath
must be extended, and a perpetual bandage from the ankle to
the knee. This, though it may produce an eruption, may be
continued for months. Bandage the head night and day.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Head-ache.</i>&mdash;For a violent head-ache, Priessnitz ordered the
body bandage to be changed every ten minutes. This did not
answer&mdash;when patient was relieved by the following treatment;
a rubbing-sheet for five minutes, and sitz-bath for an hour,
the head being bandaged all the time.</p>


<p class="mt15em">A lady of a fine strong constitution, suffering from intense
nervous head-ache, was treated as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Morning, packing-sheet and bath, followed by head-bath,
three minutes to each side, and the same to the back, making
nine minutes; noon, rubbing-sheet, sitz-bath; afternoon as in
the morning. Patient always went without stockings and
bonnet. In three months health much improved and headache
less frequent.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Head-ache.</i>&mdash;Some head-aches are relieved by fomenting the
forehead and temples with towels wetted with hot water for
half an hour, occasionally washing and rubbing those parts with
cold water; when, if not cured, the treatment should be repeated,
and afterwards a bandage may be applied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="160"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160"></a></span></p>


<h3>LX.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Acute Inflammation in the Head, Chest
and Abdomen.</span></h3>

<p>Frequent rubbing-sheets; packing-sheets, and sitz-bath, cut
short the premonitory stage of the disease. In the event of increase
of pain and fever, tepid bath 62 to 64 deg. should be
used, and patient kept in it until the axillæ are cold. Packing-sheet,
after the lapse of twenty-four, thirty-six, or forty-eight
hours, when all inflammatory symptoms have ceased, may be
had recourse to. Should these symptoms return, the tepid
bath must be repeated, and its duration regulated by circumstances.</p>


<h3>LXI.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Chilblains.</span></h3>

<p>Put the part affected in tepid water three times a day for
twenty minutes; if the fingers are attacked, apply a bandage
from the wrist to the elbow; if the toes, from the ankle to the
knee, and wear it night and day.</p>


<h3>LXII.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Cold Feet.</span></h3>

<p>When cold, to be well rubbed with wet hands, but <i>never</i> put
into a bath. To cure cold feet, rubbing-sheet to the whole
body, and friction to the feet two or three times a day; after
which, walk about room, or passage, or cold wet stones, for
ten or fifteen minutes, or until heat has returned. Persons
suffering from cold feet, on going to bed at night may use the
bandage as follows: first bring heat to the feet by exercise or
friction; then put a bandage into cold water, wring it out well,
envelope the feet in it, and over that place a thick dry bandage.</p>


<h3>LXIII.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Cold Hands And Whitlow.</span></h3>

<p>Rub the hands with snow or cold water and let them dry of
themselves; when they are wounded, keep the snow or water
away from them. To draw heat or bad matter from the hands,
bandage from the wrist to elbow and use elbow-bath, fifteen
minutes each time. In ordinary cases of whitlow, rub the
finger, hand and wrist often with wet hand, and bandage the
finger at night. If obstinate, resort to the same treatment as
for cold hands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="161"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161"></a></span></p>


<h3>LXIV.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Bunnion and Enlarged Glands of Foot and
Instep.</span></h3>

<p>A lady aged 45 was ordered&mdash;morning, packing-sheet
twenty minutes and tepid bath 62°; noon, sitz-bath fifteen
minutes; afternoon, rubbing-sheet. Bandage to feet and legs up
to the knees at night, and from ankles to knees only by day
If the feet are wounded by tight boots, take foot-baths twice
a-day and wear a bandage on the feet at night.</p>


<h3>LXV.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Depression of Spirits, Head-Ache, etc.</span></h3>

<p>A patient derived immediate relief from the following treatment:
morning, packing-sheet half an hour, then tepid bath
two minutes, cold three or four minutes, and back to the tepid;
noon, rubbing-sheet, sitz-bath fifteen minutes and head-bath
ten minutes; afternoon, morning treatment repeated. When
better, the packing-sheet in the afternoon was abandoned for a
sitz-bath ten minutes. On dreary wet days the packing-sheet
was to be resorted to again. After the sitz-bath, the feet were
to be put into water for two or three minutes and well rubbed.</p>


<h3>LXVI.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Deafness.</span></h3>

<p>Away from Gräfenberg, persons are recommended to use the
rubbing-sheet twice a-day, take a foot-bath ten minutes, and
wear a bandage round the ears at night.</p>

<p>A young man from Hambro&rsquo;, suffering from deafness, followed
up the general treatment for three or four months, when
a boil appeared on his abdomen and increased to the size of an
egg; this burst whilst patient was taking the douche: from
that time he heard as well as ever.</p>


<h3>LXVII.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Hernia and Constipation.</span></h3>

<p>Both these complaints, which are so completely out of the
reach of drugs, are always cured by hydropathy.</p>

<p>Don&mdash;&mdash;, late minister from a foreign court to England,
through my interpretation, inquired of Priessnitz how long he
should be before he was cured of constipation? A twelvemonth.<span class="pagenum" title="162"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162"></a></span>
How long of my hernia? Four months. His treatment was
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Morning, packing-sheet and tepid bath, afterwards changed
to cold bath; noon, rubbing-sheet and sitz-bath; afternoon,
as in the morning; bandage to the hernia and round the waist
always.</p>

<p>In about four months hernia was perfectly cured and patient
declared that as he eat, slept, and walked well, he considered
himself in health, and consequently left Gräfenberg. I heard
from him in Rome afterwards, when he continued perfectly
satisfied.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Hernia.</i>&mdash;A German baron, thirty-five years of age, assured
me that nine months before I made his acquaintance, he came
to Gräfenberg for hernia: that he had been cured the last two
months, but he was waiting to be assured of it.</p>

<p>He was induced to come, from a captain in his regiment
having been cured of a double rupture two years before.</p>

<p>Cases <i>ad infinitum</i> might be quoted to show the certainty
of the Water-cure effecting cures of this nature.</p>


<h3>LXVIII.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Liver Complaint, Congestion of Blood in
the Head, Enlarged Vein in the Leg.</span></h3>

<p>An English M.D., 70 years of age, was attacked with yellow
fever in the tropics, which affected his liver, when indigestion
and dyspepsia resulted.</p>

<p>At Rome, being seized with pain in the heart and congestion
of blood in the head, he was bled: finding himself no better,
he proceeded for the best advice to Paris, where depletion
was again recommended. This determined him to go to
Gräfenberg.</p>

<p>The doctor told me Priessnitz took a most accurate view of
his case: he began by packing-sheets and tepid-bath, morning
and evening; rubbing-sheets, sitz and foot-baths at noon.</p>

<p>The treatment caused him varied sensations, but generally a
tendency to healthy action. One day he felt unusual pain
about the region of the heart, and congestion in the head.
Having a gouty tendency in his system, he became alarmed,
and sent for Priessnitz, who put a large wet bandage doubled
in the form of a shawl over his shoulders, and over the region<span class="pagenum" title="163"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163"></a></span>
of the heart, and then requested him to put his feet up to the
knees in cold water for half an hour.</p>

<p>The doctor declared to me, that if asked a question as to the
danger of such a proceeding, he should have said that he
thought death would immediately ensue, and that but for the
confidence Priessnitz&rsquo; success, as witnessed by himself, had created,
no power on earth could have induced him in such a
complaint to follow the orders thus given. As it was, however,
he plunged his feet into the water at once in presence of Priessnitz,
who stood with him the whole time. By degrees the
symptoms decreased; in an hour after the operation he was
completely relieved, and that night slept remarkably well.</p>

<p>For a slight attack of fever, the doctor was prescribed five
or six rubbing-sheets and a head-bath, to walk in the open
air, and change his body-bandage in the night. At another
time, for blood to the head and great nervousness, he bathed
the head after dinner, bandaged the neck and dispensed with
neck handkerchief.</p>

<p>When the doctor first came to Gräfenberg, his walks were
limited to the piazza in front of his rooms; these were extended
by degrees, until even during the inclemency of the winter
and the depth of snow everywhere encountered, he extended his
walks thrice a day up into the woods, and was always the first
to be seen out in the morning. In about nine months, the
gentleman was completely cured of all his ailments.</p>


<h3>LXIX.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Deformity.</span></h3>

<p>An artisan kept his bed for a long time, his illness is supposed
to have originated in a cold. He was almost bent double.
In this state he went to Carlsbad, where the waters rendered
him so weak that he moved about with great difficulty. In
this state he came to Gräfenberg.</p>

<p>Morning, packing-sheet one hour, bath three minutes; noon,
two rubbing-sheets and sitz-bath; afternoon as the morning.</p>

<p>Large bandage round the loins, drank twenty tumblers of
water before breakfast; and twenty more during the day.</p>

<p>In about three months this patient was able to ascend the
highest hills, then he was ordered to carry loads of wood on
his head, and put a stick behind his back through his arms
at all times, to assist in bringing him straight. He staid all<span class="pagenum" title="164"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164"></a></span>
the winter: in the spring his health was perfect, and he was
nearly upright when I left him at Gräfenberg.</p>


<h3>LXX.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Spinal Complaints.</span></h3>

<p>Priessnitz says it is difficult to prescribe for these complaints
at a distance; and that except in young people, or where
the disease is in its infancy, a cure is seldom effected. It is
however always safe to adopt the following treatment, which
will refresh and strengthen the patient.</p>

<p>Three rubbing-sheets, at intervals during the day.</p>

<p>One or two foot-baths, but <span class="smcap">NO</span> sitz-baths without advice.</p>

<p>If the feet swell, continue the treatment, all the same, rub
with wet hands, and bandage the legs, from the ankle to the
knee, this will reduce the swelling.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Spine complaint and general debility.</i>&mdash;A lady.</p>

<p>Morning, packing-sheet until warm, followed by plunge-bath
one minute; noon, douche three minutes, return home
and then take a rubbing-sheet and sitz-bath, twenty minutes;
afternoon, as in the morning.</p>

<p>Rubbed the back and nape of the neck with wet hands,
twice a day.</p>

<p>Patient staid all the winter; during which time symptoms
were combated as they arose, she gained strength and flesh.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Spinal affection.</i>&mdash;A young lady, after submitting to all sorts
of medical treatment for three or four years, came to Gräfenberg.
She was clothed in flannel, suffered greatly from indigestion,
constipation, and languid circulation, feet always cold, walking
a short distance brought on pain in the back.</p>

<p>Second day after her arrival, Priessnitz ordered,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Put aside all flannel, go as lightly clad as possible, keep
bed-room window open day and night, and sleep with only a
single sheet as a covering, leave off stockings and run bare-footed
on the wet grass near the house, or on the cold stones
of the passage for half an hour before breakfast in the
morning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eat black bread and drink sour milk, lie on the stomach
and have the spine rubbed several times a day with wet hands.&rdquo;</p>

<p>First four days, patient had cold feet in and after the<span class="pagenum" title="165"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165"></a></span>
packing-sheet, this was then followed by tepid, then cold, and
back to tepid-bath, feet well rubbed, previous to going into
packing-sheet, and last thing at night; by this treatment head-ache
was relieved and the feet became warmer.</p>

<p>In ten days began the douche for one minute; digestion
improved; no longer constipated. Bandages always round the
body, and to feet and legs at night.</p>

<p>Patient was at Gräfenberg nine months, during which time
the treatment was often changed to meet circumstances. One
time, suppressed catamenia was relieved in two days by
sixteen rubbing-sheets a day. At another, patient met with
an accident in the leg; Priessnitz to keep this to the surface,
ordered more water to be drunk. This patient left Gräfenberg
in excellent health, though not entirely cured of the affection
of the spine, that being out of its perpendicular position.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Pain in the Shoulder and Chest.</i>&mdash;A lady in the treatment
complained of pain in the shoulder and left breast, and down
the side.</p>

<p>Ordered, when in sitz-bath the upper part of the body to be
well rubbed.</p>

<p>Body bandage to be more wrung out than usual, and extra
covering over it.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Pain in the side, Chronic cold in the head.</i>&mdash;A German officer
aged 50, afflicted as above, and with continued stoppage in the
nose, and frequent head-aches, was told by his medical man
that he had no chance of being cured, was completely relieved
at Gräfenberg, in three or four months.</p>

<p>Packing-sheets and tepid baths twice a day. Rubbing-sheet
and sitz-baths were resorted to for a short time, the cold
bath substituted for the tepid bath, and to this treatment the
douche was added.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Weak Chest and Worms.</i>&mdash;A child three years old. Wash
with tepid water, 12° once, and after some time twice a day.</p>

<p>Wear body bandage always, and drink water.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Pain in the Chest.</i>&mdash;A gentleman had pain in his chest, like
the hurt from a blow, about the size of a crown-piece.</p>

<p>Ordered sixteen rubbing-sheets a day, <i>four at each time</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="166"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166"></a></span></p>


<h3>LXXI.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Constipation.</span></h3>

<p>This complaint is always relieved, and if sufficient time is
devoted to the treatment, finally overcome by Hydropathy;
space forbids my going into details, or numerous cases might
be given in proof of this assertion. The reader&rsquo;s attention
may however be called to the <a href="#To_the_Editor_of_the_Tribune">letter</a> addressed to a newspaper,
and signed by upwards of one hundred patients, giving the
case of the son of Prince Leichtenstein, who was cured in a
few days of Constipation, which had endured twenty-eight days
in defiance of all medical aid. To effect a permanent cure, the
treatment must be persevered in for a long time, very often a
twelvemonth.</p>

<p>In a recent case. Rubbing-sheets until feverish heat ceases:
sometimes four or three suffice; at others the number must be
increased to sixteen or twenty, to be immediately followed by
a clyster. Then take a walk, and on returning, a sitz-bath
fifteen to twenty minutes, the abdomen to be well rubbed the
whole time.</p>

<p>Body bandage to be worn always and often changed. This
treatment to be resorted to twice a day. Great exercise to
be used, and cold light food to be partaken of.</p>


<p class="mt15em">A delicate lady who had suffered from this complaint for
upwards of twenty years, was relieved in a fortnight, and had
no return of it during her stay at Gräfenberg. Her principal
treatment was:&mdash;</p>

<p>Packing-sheet and bath twice a day. Rubbing-sheet and
sitz-bath at noon.</p>

<p>A second case, which came under my observation, was that
of a Russian, who for many years had only been relieved by
medicine or enemas. He went to an establishment at Moscow
for six months, where he derived great benefit, though he still
used enemas. At Gräfenberg he abandoned the latter, his
bowels were relaxed and have continued so ever since.</p>


<h3>LXXII.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Indigestion.</span></h3>

<p>Foul tongue and pain at the pit of the stomach; a lady
having tried all other remedies, was ordered the following,
which answered admirably.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="167"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167"></a></span></p>

<p>Three cold sitz-baths a day, for an hour each time, rubbing
the abdomen the whole time, eat nothing but brown bread
and drink sour milk during three days.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Loss of Appetite, Foul Tongue, etc.</i>&mdash;Patient had foul tongue,
and loss of appetite.</p>

<p>Morning.&mdash;Sweating and tepid bath, stomach to be well
rubbed in the bath. Sitz-bath thirty minutes in the afternoon.</p>

<p>It is very essential to drink abundantly of water, and take
great exercise.</p>


<p class="mt15em">A child five years old. Pale, foul tongue, loss of appetite,
thirsty and awaking with screams. Ablution in the morning,
and three tepid sitz-baths daily four minutes each; chest, back,
and abdomen to [be] well rubbed all the time; waist bandage day
night. Drink as much water as possible. Cured in three
months.</p>


<h3>LXXIII.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Stomach Complaint.</span></h3>

<p>Patient&rsquo;s stomach deranged, food used to return to his mouth:
difficult of cure. His second visit to Gräfenberg, cured in nine
months. Packing-sheets and rubbing-sheets. Noon, douche,
rubbing-sheet and sitz-bath; afternoon, packing-sheet and bath.</p>


<h3>LXXIV.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Throwing Food off the Stomach.</span></h3>

<p>Morning, rubbing-sheet and sitz-bath fifteen minutes. Noon,
the same repeated. Afternoon, sitz-bath.</p>

<p>A gentleman of my acquaintance pursued three or four
months&rsquo; treatment for this complaint, and left Gräfenberg
without being cured.</p>


<h3>LXXV.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Heartburn.</span></h3>

<p>Drink large quantit[i]es of water fasting, rub the part with wet
hands and wear a large bandage, changed often, round the
waist. If this does not effect a cure, take a rubbing-sheet or
two and a tepid sitz-bath twice a day. Nausea and sickness
are to be treated in the same manner; if, however, the latter
become chronic, then packing-sheets, tepid baths, and<span class="pagenum" title="168"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168"></a></span>
sitz-baths must be resorted to. The diet should be brown bread
and milk only. The milk should be boiled, if it otherwise
disagrees with the patient.</p>


<h3>LXXVI.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Sea Sickness.</span></h3>

<p>To avoid sea-sickness or relieve it. The traveller should lay
on his back, and place a large wet towel on his abdomen,
changing it when dry. After a sea voyage take a few rubbing-sheets
and sitz-baths. Wear a waist bandage, and if constipated
resort to cold water clysters.</p>


<h3>LXXVII.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Palpitation of the Heart.</span></h3>

<p>Many rubbing-sheets; rub the whole, side for a long time and
often. Large bandage. Two sitz-baths a day, fifteen minutes
each; rubbing the afflicted side the whole time. A lady
afflicted as above was relieved in ten minutes by the rubbing-sheets,
and dabbling her feet well in cold water.</p>


<h3>LXXVIII.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Want of Sleep.</span></h3>

<p>Before going to bed, take a shallow foot-bath (only to cover
the soles of the foot) for seven to ten minutes, rubbing the
feet to above the ankles all the time, then walk about the room
bare-footed until the feet are quite warm.</p>

<p>A lady, in the treatment, complained of want of sleep.</p>

<p>Two packing-sheets in the afternoon, the first changed as
soon as hot, followed by tepid bath.</p>

<p>Two foot-baths for one hour each, the water only to cover
the soles of the feet. Feet to be well rubbed the whole time.
When the servant is tired of rubbing, patient should walk
about the room with bare feet for a few minutes and then resume
the foot-bath.</p>


<h3>LXXIX.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Languid Circulation.</span></h3>

<p>I attended many cases of this kind with Mr. Priessnitz,
where the languid circulation arose from using the head more
than the body. In a general way he began with rubbing-sheets
in the morning and afternoon for a few days, and then
in the morning packing-sheet until warm, and tepid bath,<span class="pagenum" title="169"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169"></a></span>
cold bath, and back to tepid bath. Noon, rubbing-sheet and
tepid sitz-bath fifteen minutes; afternoon, packing-sheet and
tepid baths as in the morning; or a rubbing-sheet. Bandaged
always.</p>


<h3>LXXX.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ring Worm.</span></h3>

<p>A boy aged seven years had ring worm over the eye and
behind his knees. Cured in six weeks. Two packing-sheets
and tepid baths daily. Bandage to the knees. Child could
not endure the douche.</p>


<h3>LXXXI.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Hands Frost-bitten or Suffering from
a Boil.</span></h3>

<p>Rub the hands well with tepid water, and particularly the
wrist. Put the elbow into cold water for twenty minutes,
three times a day. Bandage the whole arm from the arm-pits
down to the wrist.</p>


<h3>LXXXII.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Weak Eyes and Eruption on the Head.</span></h3>

<p>A child two years old had weak eyes, from which there was
a constant discharge and an eruption on the face and head; it
was treated as follow:&mdash;</p>

<p>Packing-sheet one hour and sometimes longer, followed by
tepid bath. Large bandage from hips to arm-pits night and
day. Dabbed the face often with cold water and bandaged the
head at night. In three weeks eyes quite well and the eruption
diminished.</p>


<h3>LXXXIII.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Weak Ankles.</span></h3>

<p>If an infant, ablution every morning and bandage the ankles
night and day. If an older person, ablution and foot-baths
twenty minutes. Morning and afternoon, bandage always.</p>


<h3>LXXXIV.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Treatment of Infants.</span></h3>

<p>Immediately after birth bathe the infant in warm water 82°,
put a wet bandage on navel, bound on with a dry one, change
it morning and evening <i>only</i>. Continue this until the navel is
healed. The temperature of the bath to be reduced two<span class="pagenum" title="170"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170"></a></span>
degrees every fortnight, until 68°, which is to be used until
child can run alone. It may be washed with cold water at
three months of age.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>If an Infant is uneasy or restless and cries.</i>&mdash;Put on a body
bandage; if this is not sufficient, give it an extra tepid-bath.</p>

<p>The child of an Hungarian commissioner was born weak and
sickly, with great difficulty in breathing. The physicians
treated the mother to improve the milk, when the child refused
the breast. From three days old it was spoon-fed. On the
fifth or sixth day, the father put the child into a packing-sheet
until it was warm, when he changed it, and then applied the
tepid-bath.</p>

<p>After four day&rsquo;s treatment a lump appeared on the chest,
which increased until it became as large as a man&rsquo;s fist. On the
eighth day it broke, and half a tumbler of matter was discharged.
From this moment the child gradually improved and is
now the healthiest of his children.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Child-teething, Pain in the Head, and Diarrh&oelig;a.</i>&mdash;Tepid bath
for about five minutes three times a day.</p>

<p>Two head-baths from ten to fifteen minutes each, and one
clyster.</p>

<p>A body bandage, and change it often.</p>


<h3>LXXXV.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Epilepsy.</span></h3>

<p>This complaint in a general way is not to be cured by Hydropathy;
but Priessnitz thinks persons subject to it should use
cold baths, and cold water as a beverage. I know a young
man who was six months at Gräfenberg, it is now twelve-months
since, and as he has not had an attack, he considers
himself cured.</p>


<h3>LXXXVI.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Hypochondria and Hysteria.</span></h3>

<p>A disarrangement of the system, and inaction of the
abdomen, cause much uneasiness and discontent. This disease
being moral as well as physical, requires pure air, scenery,
society, and a complete change in the manner of living.
What is so calculated to combat this complaint as Hydropathy?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="171"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171"></a></span></p>

<p>A patient became hypochondriac, in consequence of chronic
derangement of bowels, struck with rush of blood to the head,
face became crimson, lost speech and consciousness, had convulsions
and spasmodic movement of the arms.</p>

<p>First operation was to put him into a cold bath, and use
strong friction for an hour. He was put into a packing-sheet, in
which he became delirious; he was then rubbed by four men
in a tepid bath, 64°. He was still unconscious and yet winced
on being pinched; water thrown on his head caused a slight
cry; great heat on the head. On ceasing the cold affusion,
pulse though oppressed began to be felt&mdash;eyes fixed&mdash;conjunctiva
inflamed.</p>

<p>Friction continued two hours, then ceased for one hour and
a half, and begun again: in an hour spasms ceased, eyes began
to move, without seeing. Patient apparently exhausted,
pulse gained its power, though still often intermittent, upper
part of the body hot, lower extremities could not be warmed
all night, consciousness had not returned in the morning,
pulse better, but sleep interrupted,&mdash;patient groaning. All
night wet bandage applied to the head. At 6 o&rsquo;clock next
morning, sweating process, perspiration preceded consciousness,
up to which moment patient was insensible to all that had
occurred. After half an hour&rsquo;s sweating, he was well rubbed
in tepid bath 66°, and put to bed, when he slept. On awaking
he partook of bread and milk.</p>

<p>At 2 o&rsquo;clock <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>, awoke covered with perspiration, and
from that time until next morning, slept at intervals, pulse
regular, talked calmly and rationally, bowels in a normal state.</p>

<p>In the morning, packing-sheet; and later, sweating process;
both followed by tepid bath 64°&mdash;temperature of the body still
high. After good night&rsquo;s rest, appetite returned, and so much
better as to renew the treatment to effect a cure of that which
brought him to Gräfenberg.</p>


<h3>LXXXVII.&mdash;<span class="smcap">F&oelig;tid Perspiration of the Feet.</span></h3>

<p>This is relieved by foot-baths, and wearing a bandage on the
feet at night; but it cannot be cured without the sweating
process.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="172"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172"></a></span></p>


<h3>LXXXVIII.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Stricture.</span></h3>

<p>Sweating and tepid bath, and cold sitz-baths, are generally
resorted to in this complaint. If cold water is found too severe,
tepid is used for a time; a bandage is always applied to parts
affected.</p>

<p>For stoppage of the water, three to six rubbing-sheets; if
they fail, resort to sweating process until water comes, then
a tepid bath, or rubbing-sheet.</p>

<p>Medical men, to effect this object, put the patient first into
a warm bath, and then bleed him until he faints: by these
means, the prostate gland becomes relaxed, and water flows;
or water is passed by the use of catheters, which at Gräfenberg
are always dispensed with.</p>


<h3>LXXXIX.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Inflammation of the Kidneys And
Urethra.</span></h3>

<p>The treatment must be regulated by circumstances: sometimes
sweating, at other times the packing-sheet, tepid bath, and
bandage.</p>


<h3>XC.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Hydrocephalus.</span></h3>

<p>A child one year and a-half old had water on the brain, and a
large protuberance in the middle of the forehead. Ordered, a
tepid bath morning and evening; a rubbing-sheet after an
hour&rsquo;s sleep at noon, and repeated before going to bed at night.
Drank water only at meals, and then but little. Bandage from
arm-pits down to the knees; was much in the open air. After
twelve months, the protuberance went down, leaving a ridge
like a pigeon&rsquo;s breast down the centre; shape of head completely
changed, and the boy was perfectly well.</p>


<h3>XCI.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Syphilis.</span></h3>

<p>This complaint always succumbs to the treatment; and a
cure effected by it leaves none of those lamentable consequences
which attend the exhibition of drugs. By Hydropathic means,
the virus is completely thrown out of the system through
the pores; whilst the administration of mercury is attended
with secondary symptoms, which are more fatal than the<span class="pagenum" title="173"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173"></a></span>
disease itself. If taken in time, secondary symptoms are also
cured at Gräfenberg. It frequently happens, that patients treated
for another complaint, find syphilis return, though they imagined
themselves cured of it years before. Recent cases of syphilis
in otherwise healthy persons, are generally cured in less than
two months; but the cure of secondary symptoms is a work of
time. There are many sufferers from this undermining malady,
who have been at Gräfenberg one, two, and even three years.
In health, they, are much improved; but the malady is too
deeply seated to be eradicated. One gentleman, when I was
there, was refused admittance; he died in a few days, when it
was found that mercury had eaten part of his wind-pipe away&mdash;a
result that never could have been brought about by water.
The following is another deplorable case, the result of bad
treatment:&mdash;Patient aged thirty-five, tall, thin, and bent when
walking; supports his head by pressing his hands on each side
of it; part of the cranium destroyed. The brain covered over
by a skin; the parietal bones destroyed, and thick pus exudes
between the skin and bone, and smells horribly. Inside of the
left eye is an ulceration with raised borders, which allows a
portion of the orbital arch to be seen surrounded with pus;
pulse weak and irregular; constant pain. Treated for secondary
symptoms, with mercury in 1841; came to Gräfenberg
with three ulcers the size of a shilling on his forehead, with
burning pains. Packing-sheets and tepid baths morning and
evening, with other intermediate treatment. This case is introduced
to show the sort of cases Mr. Priessnitz will undertake:
of course, a cure will require a considerable time.</p>


<h3>XCII.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Chancre.</span></h3>

<p>Case of a very strong young man:&mdash;</p>

<p>For five days&mdash;sweating (after perspiration broke out) morning,
one hour; afternoon, half an hour; then tepid bath, followed
by cold bath and back to tepid. After five days&mdash;from sweating
went into plunging cold bath; in another week, douched from
two to five minutes at eleven o&rsquo;clock; bandage round the body
and on the sores, which were bathed and had water thrown
on them frequently; wore suspending bandages; eat sparingly;
no meat or butter, and took but little exercise. Perfectly cured
in six weeks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="174"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174"></a></span></p>


<h3>XCIII.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Gonorrh&oelig;a and Chancres.</span></h3>

<p>Sweating, followed by bath in the morning; douche at eleven;
at twelve, rubbing-sheet and sitz-bath; afternoon, packing-sheet
and bath; chancres increased to the size of a sixpence
then, and in two days cicatrised. Patient cured in twenty-five
days.</p>

<p><i>Gonorrh&oelig;a, &amp;c.</i>&mdash;Packing-sheet, tepid bath, and sitz-baths
were the means used. The complaint continuing, Priessnitz
supposed it arose from debility of the parts, and ordered:&mdash;</p>

<p>Six sitz-baths of ten minutes, allowing five minutes to elapse
between each, twice a-day; packing-sheets to be changed as
soon as warm, followed by cold bath.</p>


<p class="mt15em">A young man, immediately on discovering this complaint,
who took sitz-baths as above described, injected cold water into
the urethra, bandaged the parts and drank plentifully of cold
water and lived low; was cured in two days.</p>


<p class="mt15em">Another person was subject to involuntary emissions, by
which his strength was wasting away. In a month after he
began the cure, he found an old gonorrh&oelig;a return (which had
evidently been driven into the system and was the cause of
his malady); he was now treated for this and restored to perfect
health.</p>

<p class="mt15em">A Russian officer, declared cured of chancre three years before,
found the complaint return, when he was again treated
by mercury. His throat continued to trouble him, his voice
was husky, and piles began to make their appearance. After
pursuing the Water-cure for a short time, as described in a
former case, he had a crisis in his foot, and diarrh&oelig;a for a fortnight,
when he passed a considerable quantity of blood. After
this, the piles disappeared entirely, and his voice became sound
and clear. It should be observed that he sweated alternate
mornings only; the other mornings, packing-sheets and bath.</p>


<p class="mt15em">A young man aged 23, attacked with secondary symptoms:
sore throat, etc., was ordered three packing-sheets and cold
baths a-day; rubbing-sheet and sitz-bath.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="175"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175"></a></span></p>

<p class="mt15em">I knew another strong young man suffering under secondary
symptoms, so that he could hardly walk with the use of a stick;
he went to Gräfenberg, staid there two months, and returned
to England the picture of health.</p>

<p>As there are always at Gräfenberg a large number of individuals
labouring under these complaints, cases of cure might
be adduced <i>ad infinitum</i>: suffice it to say, that hydropathy in
their cure is omnipotent. Buboes and chancres, when taken
in their infancy, are eradicated from the system in a few weeks,
sometimes days, without the debilitating effects attendant upon
other deceitful remedies.</p>


<h3>XCIV.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Scrofula and Vaccination.</span></h3>

<p>Priessnitz, when asked what he conceived to be the cause of
such an increase of scrofula as is said to have taken place of
late years, said, he attributed it to vaccination, syphilis and
drugs.</p>

<p>When vaccination is performed without producing its desired
effect, the virus remains in the system, and when it proceeds
favourably, it is a question if it is ever thoroughly ejected.</p>

<p>Every practitioner knows the difficulty that exists of finding
children from which to take matter where no taint is in the
blood. The child subjected to vaccination is not only exposed
to the sins of his own forefathers, but also to those of the
stranger.</p>

<p>The consequences attendant upon syphilis, and the evil results
of mineral poisons, are such as to lead us to believe that
Priessnitz&rsquo; opinion is not without foundation. I am doubtful
whether scrofula is ever cured,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> though whilst at Gräfenberg I
saw many obstinate cases relieved. Children who arrived there
perfect cripples, were enabled to use their limbs like other
people. I think I may in great truth say, that in all cases the
enemy received a check, and the general health of the patient
was improved.</p>

<p>A patient states, that previous to inoculation his family
were well; but since that operation they have been scrofulous.
He came to Gräfenberg some years ago from Dartres, when
Priessnitz told him to go home, give up all beverages but water,<span class="pagenum" title="176"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176"></a></span>
use cold baths daily, and he would be well; though incredulous,
he followed the advice, and in two years was perfectly
cured.</p>

<p>For scrofula, the whole treatment must be persevered in for
a long time.</p>


<h3>XCV.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Piles.</span></h3>

<p>Piles are caused by an accumulation of blood in the vessels
which merge into the large intestines; they either discharge
blood, or are confined to a swelling of the veins, in otherwise
healthy subjects. Hydropathy effects a radical cure of this
complaint, whilst medical remedies are only temporary, and
often lead to serious consequences.</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i>&mdash;Morning, three rubbing-sheets and sitz-bath,
twenty minutes; noon, the same; afternoon, the same, and an
additional sitz-bath, making four sitz-baths during the day.
At night, a rubbing-sheet but no sitz-bath, as it is too late to
walk after it. Body bandage; much water to be drunk; douche
four to eight minutes in the middle of the day, if possible.</p>

<p>Out of the general treatment, persons troubled with piles
may take sitz-baths and wear a bandage on the part affected.</p>

<p>A patient having piles and sore eyes, was advised neither to
take sitz-baths or eye-baths. When Priessnitz was asked the
reason, he said, &ldquo;Because you have too much bad matter
in your system, which I am afraid of attracting to those
parts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In a common attack of piles, two or three sitz-baths a-day,
fifteen minutes each, and wearing a bandage upon the part at
night, will afford relief.</p>

<p>Persons subject to piles should especially avoid all heating
and stimulating drinks.</p>


<h3>XCVI.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Rupture.</span></h3>

<p>I knew of a case of double rupture, in an officer 34 years of
age, which was perfectly cured at Gräfenberg in three years.
Another case of single rupture was cured in nine months, and
a recent one cured in four months.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt of the complete omnipotence of Hydropathy
over this malady; its cure is only a matter of time.<span class="pagenum" title="177"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177"></a></span>
It is difficult to lay down any prescribed treatment, as the
chief aim of the practitioner must be to bring his patient into
fine health. All organic action is contraction; all strength
depends upon the power of the different parts of the body to
contract, and nothing will aid the operation so much as the
different appliances here made use of. As a rule, I observed
that when rupture exudes, the sweating process should be resorted
to; when perspiration has broken out, gently rub the
part with the hand until the rupture is gone in again. Bandages
are worn continually.</p>


<h3>XCVII.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Chilblains.</span></h3>

<p>Rub the feet or hands affected for a quarter of an hour in tepid
water three times a-day, and bandage the leg from ankle to knee
if in the feet. If in the hand, the arm from wrist to elbow.</p>


<h3>XCVIII.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Cold Feet.</span></h3>

<p>Take a shallow foot-bath, cold, one inch deep, before going to
bed, for fifteen minutes; let the feet be well rubbed the whole
time, then walk about the room bare-footed for half an hour,
so that re-action may take place, or they will be colder than
before.</p>


<h3>XCIX.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Eruption, Scabs, and Sores on the Arms.</span></h3>

<p>A child had tried sulphur bandages and all other conceivable
means:&mdash;</p>

<p>Morning, noon, and afternoon, packing-sheet and tepid-bath;
the latter after a few days changed to the cold-bath; bandages
night and day; cure effected in a few weeks.</p>


<h3>C.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Consumption.</span></h3>

<p>Until the age of fifteen or sixteen Priessnitz conceives this
complaint to be always curable. Very often when parties are
supposed to be consumptive, they are not so. A young lady
arrived at Gräfenberg during my stay there. I thought she
had delayed it too long; she appeared in the last stage of consumption.
Priessnitz however took the case&mdash;and, principally
with rubbing-sheets, administered three times a-day, effected<span class="pagenum" title="178"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178"></a></span>
an extraordinary cure in two months. I saw this lady afterwards
at Florence, and was quite surprised to see what an extremely
fine woman she had become.</p>


<p class="mt15em">There was also a young lady suffering under the following
symptoms:&mdash;great debility, very thin, weak eyes, little or no
appetite, and a short cough, which would awaken her about
four o&rsquo;clock in the morning, and trouble her the whole day.
She was considered by M.D.&rsquo;s as consumptive. Priessnitz took
a different view of the case, and as she was cured in two
months he was right. Her treatment was as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Morning, packing-sheet and plunge bath, the tepid-bath
having been used only for a short time; at ten o&rsquo;clock, douche;
at eleven, rubbing-sheet and eye-bath; at five, packing-sheet
and bath; chest, waist, and forehead bandaged every night;
waist bandaged always.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Consumption of the Nerves.</i>&mdash;A gentleman aged 30, came to
Gräfenberg in a most deplorable state, supported on one side by
his wife, on the other by his servant. Second night he was taken
alarmingly ill, with a fever and a stoppage in his bowels. He
was too weak for a packing-sheet or tepid-bath, therefore
twelve rubbing-sheets were administered within three hours;
and two head-baths during the intermediate times. When a
change for the better took place, enemas were applied and
relief afforded. The next day patient was out of doors. I
left Gräfenberg about this time, therefore do not know if he
recovered.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Spitting Blood.</i>&mdash;A young lady was subjected to spitting
blood, pain at the chest, and general debility. Priessnitz
doubted if the lungs were affected, and tried packing-sheet and
tepid-bath, which patient was found too weak to support.
Then rubbing-sheets twice a day; patient still too weak. Then
rubbing-sheet, and tepid sitz-bath ten minutes. Feverish
excitement and loss of appetite came on. Back of head put
into cold water for quarter of an hour; to be repeated several
times a day. Bandage at all times down the middle of the
breast and round the waist. When spitting of blood came on,
then cold foot-baths were resorted to. Patient tried the treatment
for a month, but was not much improved by it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="179"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179"></a></span></p>

<p>On leaving, Priessnitz advised her to spend the winter in
Italy, to eat nothing but bread and grapes, and to use cold
ablutions.</p>


<h3>CI.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Insanity.</span></h3>

<p>This disease, Priessnitz says is curable, when it proceeds from
bodily suffering or disease; but when caused by mental suffering
or misfortune, is generally incurable. I witnessed the
treatment of a case of aberration of mind at Gräfenberg; the
patient was put into a tepid-bath, held there, and rubbed for
nine hours and a half; he was then put to bed, and next
morning awoke perfectly composed.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Hydrophobia.</i>&mdash;Dr. Short in 1656, published a work, in
which he stated, that with cold water, he had cured the bite
of mad dogs and dropsy. Priessnitz says he never treated the
human subject for this complaint, but that he had cured a dog,
by tying him up and throwing a large number of pails of water
over him. At first it caused him to shiver a great deal, proving
the absence of fever to any extent. When dry the aspersion
was repeated; the shivering diminished at each successive
aspersion, until it was entirely allayed. If, on throwing a dog,
thus treated, bread, and he will eat it, it is a sign he is cured.
Dr. Sully, of Wivelscombe, in a work published some years
ago, states, that he dropped water constantly on the wounded
part, and that it invariably acted as a preventive. My impression
is, that hydropathy is adapted to the cure of this
complaint.</p>


<h3>CII.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Cholera.</span></h3>

<p>Spasmodic or pestilential cholera first appeared in England
in 1831, and in France in 1832; great difference of opinion
exists as to its cause, and hardly two practitioners agree as to
the best way to effect a cure. Some persons think, as many
would get well without medical aid as with it; and this
conjecture is supported by what took place on its visitation in
Dublin. The numbers attacked were so great, that for the
humble class, large tents were erected outside the city, and the
medical men were so harassed by their own connexions within
it, that the poor were left very much to fate. On comparing<span class="pagenum" title="180"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180"></a></span>
notes of the mortality that took place, it was found, that the
number of deaths of those who received medical aid, and those
who were deprived of it, were about equal. Pages might be
employed in enumerating instances related, in which the cholera
was cured by cold water, though administered without
reference to any hydropathic rules. In 1832, Cholera made
great ravages in Silesia, when numbers at Freywaldau and the
neighbourhood, fell victims. Priessnitz&rsquo;s patients did not
escape, though they avoided its fatal consequences. A friend
of mine, who was at Gräfenberg at the time, assures me that
in cholera, Priessnitz never lost a case, though seventeen of his
patients, and many persons in the neighbourhood, were treated
by him. My landlord at Freywaldau, confirmed the last of
these statements, and said that his daughter fell a victim, who,
he felt persuaded, would have recovered, had she been treated
with water instead of drugs.</p>

<p>To ward off this disease, and place the system, if attacked,
in the best condition to resist it, we ask the dispassionate
reader, are not hydropathic rules in accordance with reason
and common sense?</p>

<p>There are three different stages in cholera; the first is that
of a common diarrh&oelig;a, accompanied with oppression of the
chest, anxiety, and collapse of the face; if neglected, it assumes
a more serious form, the pulse becomes weak, and there is a
difficulty of respiration.</p>

<p>The second stage is ushered in by giddiness, great depression
of pulse and of the vital energies, with spasms, accompanied by
purging and vomitings.</p>

<p>In the third stage, the patient is suddenly laid prostrate, serous
fluid, in large quantities, is discharged from the bowels and
stomach, with cramps and spasms, hardly any pulse, and difficult
respiration. Under ordinary treatment, this frequently
terminates life in a few hours.</p>

<p>To those who have witnessed the wonderful results of the
Water-cure treatment in cholic, diarrh&oelig;a, &amp;c., it must be evident,
that in the primary stages of this malady, the treatment resorted
to in those complaints, would be perfectly effectual; and that
cholera, in its worst and most fearful form, is to be successfully
combated by no other than hydropathic means.</p>

<p>If, after visiting a contagious case, Mr. Priessnitz feels at all
uncomfortable, he takes a packing-sheet and tepid-bath.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="181"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181"></a></span></p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Asiatic Cholera.</i>&mdash;On the first appearance of Cholera symptoms,
which are generally those of languor and chilliness, do
not wait for a development, but apply most vigorously a
rubbing-sheet; then dry the body, and administer a clyster of
cold water. In two or three minutes repeat the rubbing-sheet
and clyster, wait five minutes and repeat the same a third
time. Then a cold sitz-bath, letting two attendants rub the
patient with hands dipped in water, particularly on the abdomen,
the whole time; water should be drunk whilst in the sitz-bath,
until patient vomits; when cramps in the stomach and vomiting
have subsided, place a large bandage round the body, and
put him to bed well covered up. After sleeping, apply a
tepid-bath with friction for some time. If not cured, renew
the whole operation.</p>

<p>If, after the sitz-bath, cholera appears on the advance, warm
a blanket, and pack the patient as in the sweating process; if he
remains therein several hours, and the symptoms do not decrease,
renew the whole proceedings, and again try to produce perspiration;
when effected, keep it up two or three hours. After
this a tepid-bath 62° with friction. The success of the
treatment very much depends upon drinking abundantly of
water. The bandages used, should be doubled or trebled, and
changed often. If patient is unable to stand or sit upright,
lay him on a bed, and let several attendants rub him all over
with wet hands.</p>

<p>Extract from a letter from Dr. Gibbs to the editor of the
&ldquo;Water-cure Journal.&rdquo;</p>


<p>&ldquo;You cannot have forgotten the consternation of the profession
when this fearful disease invaded us in 1832. Neither
can you be ignorant that the faculty, generally, are as ill prepared
to contend with it now as they were in former years;
but for the information of those who may not be as well acquainted
with such matters as you must be, I beg to make an
extract from the minutes of the proceedings at a meeting of
the Western Medical and Surgical Association, as reported in
the <i>Lancet</i> of September 19, 1846. In the course of a discussion
on the treatment of cholera, Dr. Cahill said, that he
&lsquo;positively felt a creeping of the skin at the relation of the
enormities which had been perpetrated by practitioners upon
their patients. When he listened to the recital of practitioners
who described the extravagant cases of mercury and of opium<span class="pagenum" title="182"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182"></a></span>
which they administered, he could not refrain from fancying
that he was witnessing the orgies of so many Indian savages,
whilst counting the scalps of their victims. He thought it a
pity that the invention of such a system of torture should not
experience the fate of the inventor of the brazen bull, and
illustrate upon his own person the efficacy of his infernal
ingenuity. He believed that in the majority of persons who
died of Asiatic cholera, death was the consequence of the
treatment rather than of the disease. He had seen above a
thousand cases of Asiatic cholera; and in no instance had he
seen any benefit from any mode of treatment. On the contrary,
he had seen persons die of narcotism, who would have survived
if left to the <i>vis medicatrix naturæ</i>. He had seen others
die of absorption of air through the veins when the saline
fluid was ejected; and he knew many who had had the extraordinary
luck to escape both the doctor and the disease, yet
rendered miserable for the remainder of life by the effects
of the immense doses of mercury which had been given to
them during the cholera paroxysms. In fact, it was afflicting
to contemplate the sufferings which the rash and empirical
practice of the profession in the management of this epidemic
had created.&rsquo;The learned gentleman likewise said &lsquo;With
respect to cholera, since nothing was known of its nature, and
no treatment had any influence over it, the best plan was to
do as little as possible: give carrara, soda, or pump-water, with
a little laudanum, perhaps in the diarrh&oelig;al stage, and the
patient would not be deprived of the chance which nature had
given him.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is to be presumed that the doctor had not seen this disease
treated by the Water-cure, under the operation of which,
if I am correctly informed, and as I can readily believe, results
very different from those, which he witnessed, were obtained.
It is stated that more than twenty cases were successfully treated
by Priessnitz, and between thirty and forty at Breslau, by a clergyman,
whose name I regret that I have forgotten; and it is
added that neither practitioner lost a patient by death. The
treatment adopted by each of them was nearly the same; the
principal difference between them being, that the one employed
the sitz-bath, and the other the shallow tepid-bath.</p>

<p>[&ldquo;]If on the appearance of the premonitory symptoms, judicious
treatment be promptly adopted, it seems not improbable<span class="pagenum" title="183"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183"></a></span>
that the disease may be cut short. Those symptoms may be any
combination of the following:&mdash;shivering, dizziness, a ringing
noise in the ears, a small quick pulse, accelerated respiration,
languor, præcordial anxiety, a cold white tongue, nausea,
vomiting, severe gripings, and watery diarrh&oelig;a. If it be not
checked, the disease quickly passes into the second or algid
stage; the circulation becomes feeble, the blood is drained of
its fluid, the muscles are contracted and cramped, the tongue is
colder and whiter, the thirst becomes burning, the lips livid;
the features contracted, the extremities shrivelled, and the skin
cold, clammy, and discoloured.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Little is known respecting the nature of this disease;
but the most rational opinion seems to be, that it owes its
origin to a poison pervading the blood; deranging the balance
between the arterial and venous circulation, impairing the
nervous energy, and impeding all the functions of the various
organs, excepting the secretions from the stomach and bowels;
the preternatural excitement of which would seem to indicate
an effort of nature to expel the disturbing causes from the
system. This opinion obtains additional probability from the
fact, which often has been observed, that the more profuse is
the diarrh&oelig;a, the less fatal is the disease.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cholera may suddenly appear without manifesting any, or
at least with very slight, premonitory symptoms; especially
where the patient is labouring under any serious affection of
the brain, lungs, or air-passages, when it will sometimes graft
itself on the primary disease, and aggravate all its most various
symptoms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On the first manifestation of premonitory symptoms, immediate
recourse should be had to repeated friction in a wrung-out
sheet, as in the earlier stages of fever. This will tend to
stimulate the nervous energy, and to maintain or re-establish
the balance of circulation between the arterial and venous systems;
will counteract the disposition to internal congestion by
promoting cuticular circulation; will aid the lungs by freeing
the exhalants of the skin, and will forward the elimination of
the virus through the same channels.</p>


<p>&ldquo;But it will not be sufficient merely to attempt to resist the
encroachments of the disease; the efforts of nature to expel
the cause of it, also claim assistance. To this end cold or tepid
water should be freely drunk to facilitate the vomiting, to<span class="pagenum" title="184"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184"></a></span>
dilute and weaken the action of the poison, to stimulate the
kidneys, and to supply the waste of fluid in the blood. Dr.
Rutty, in his synopsis, says, &lsquo;It <ins title="Transcriber's Note: author&rsquo;s insertion">[the drinking of water]</ins> has also
frequently been found efficacious in stopping violent vomitings
and purgings, partly as a diluent, and partly as a bracer to
the fibres; and in violent, deplorable choleras, cold water is
recommended by the ancients, and at this time is ordered by
Spanish physicians with good success, though Celsus orders it
warm.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Enemata of pure water, tepid or cold, should likewise be
freely administered; the quantity administered to an infant at
one time should not exceed two ounces; four ounces would be
sufficient for a child six years old; eight ounces for a youth of
fifteen, and fifteen or sixteen ounces for an adult.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the principal process is <i>long and entire friction</i>, either in
the shallow tepid-bath or in the sitz-bath. The latter seems
to deserve the preference, inasmuch as it will more directly
and powerfully aid nature in her efforts; its primary action
being that of a purgative, while a less body of water will
suffice, than could be made to fulfil the same intention in a
vessel of the shape and size of the half bath; but, if the sitz-bath
be employed, then friction with wet hands should be
applied to the extremities. Cold water may be used in the
sitz-bath, provided that there is nothing in the previous state
of the patient to contra-indicate its use; in which case tepid
water must be employed. Tepid water about 70° Fahr. may
likewise be employed in the shallow bath, as the body of water
therein must be greater than the sitz-bath; but warm applications
are never indicated. Vapour-baths have been tried to
recall the circulation to the surface, but without effect. On
this point, Dr. Daun in his &lsquo;Medical Reports on Cholera,&rsquo;
says, &lsquo;O&rsquo;Brien lay on the steam couch for three hours before
he expired, in a heat that I am convinced would have raised a
lifeless body to a temperature nearly, if not equal, to that of a
person in health; but his body preserved an icy coldness to the
last.&rsquo; In this case friction in wrung-out sheets, or in the shallow
bath, or perhaps the stimulus of the cold dash, would seem
to be indicated.</p>


<p>&ldquo;Cramps, in the extremities, should be combated with brisk
friction, with wet hands to the parts affected. It is often
necessary to draw off the urine with a catheter. Before the<span class="pagenum" title="185"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185"></a></span>
algid stage sets in, the heating bandage round the body may
be very beneficial; but during the algid stage it should be
omitted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The third stage or that of re-action, is marked by the
following, among other symptoms; the pulse becomes fuller
and harder, the skin becomes warm, and its livid discoloration
disappears; the tongue becomes red and warm, the cramps
cease, diarrh&oelig;a decreases and stops, and the kidneys begin to
act. In this case it is well to encourage moderate diaphoresis
in the dry blanket.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The predisposing causes to cholera are any excess in eating
or drinking, the habitual use of alcoholic liquors, unwholesome
food, sitting with wet feet, a neglected cold, uncleanliness,
impure air, deficient light or ventilation, and violent indulgence
of the passions.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>CIII.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Colds, Sore Throats, etc.</span></h3>

<p><i>Influenza.</i>&mdash;This complaint which commits such ravages, is
always easy of cure.</p>

<p>When a person feels heaviness in the head, sore throat, pain
in bowels, and lassitude, he should immediately be put in the
packing-sheet until quite hot, then a tepid bath for five or six
minutes, and be well rubbed all the time. This treatment to
be repeated during the day. Drink plentifully of water, wear
a bandage round the waist and throat; if cold and chilly, take
two or three rubbing-sheets. To relieve the heaviness of the
head, resort to a foot-bath 62° for fifteen minutes. Influenza
generally succumbs to this treatment in two or three days.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Sore Throat or Quinzy.</i>&mdash;On the slightest symptoms of sore
throat, rub it well for five minutes with wet hands two or
three times a day; hold cold water constantly in the mouth,
and with it gargle the throat, and wear a bandage, this generally
prevents the complaint proceeding further; if it does not,
more vigorous measures, such as those pointed out for a cold,
must be pursued. For Quinzy, the sweating process and
tepid-bath twice a day also, or two rubbing-sheets in the intermediate
time must be used, a bandage several times doubled
and often changed, applied round the throat and waist, and
much water drank, gargled, and held in the mouth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="186"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186"></a></span></p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Heaviness after dinner.</i>&mdash;Pour a bottle of water on the head,
and take head-baths occasionally.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Bronchitis.</i>&mdash;In all old affections of the throat a cure is
doubtful, it requires the discrimination of Priessnitz to determine
which will and which will not be benefited by the Water-cure.</p>

<p>I should say the majority of cases of bronchitis are beyond
remedy. At the same time, it cannot be denied that very
extraordinary throat affections are cured, especially when they
arise from secondary symptoms.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Palpitation of the Heart, stitches in the side, etc.</i>&mdash;A young
lady felt violent palpitation of the heart, and numbness of the
whole side of the body. Three-rubbing sheets and a foot-bath
with friction, allayed the palpitation, then a body <i>umschlag</i>
was applied. Next night the same symptoms returned, and
were combated in the like manner, afterwards the patient was
treated with packing-sheets, tepid-bath, foot-bath, and douche.
Whenever any obstructions of this nature occur, it is always
safe to resort to rubbing-sheets two or three times a day.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Erysipelas.</i>&mdash;This disease is an effort of nature to relieve
itself by the skin; the packing-sheet process in this case is
resorted to, followed by a rubbing-sheet or tepid-bath: when
the head is overcharged, sometimes the body is placed in a
packing-sheet (previously put into tepid water instead of cold)
from the arm-pits to the knees, and then a tepid-bath or
a bath with very little water in it. Much water should be
drunk, and bandages applied to parts affected.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>To refresh and invigorate.</i>&mdash;A gentleman with no decided
complaint, but generally feeling a degree of languor, and want
of nervous energy was ordered, a rubbing-sheet in the morning
and afternoon, and a sitz-bath in the middle of the day,
followed by much exercise.</p>


<p class="mt15em">Another party felt somewhat below his usual standard of
health and activity. For years there had been an accumulation
of matter in his nose, from which at times there was a free
discharge. Priessnitz said it was a sort of safety valve, and
had better not be stopped: the patient derived great advantage
from pursuing the following treatment for six weeks:<span class="pagenum" title="187"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187"></a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>In the morning, a packing-sheet for twenty minutes, then
changed for another for fifteen minutes; this was followed,
first by tepid, and afterwards by cold bath; at noon, a rubbing-sheet
and sitz-bath for fifteen minutes; head-bath three minutes
each side, making in all nine minutes; in the afternoon,
rubbing-sheet, sitz and head-bath.</p>


<h3>CIV.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Cancer, etc.</span></h3>

<p>When taken in the commencement, this disease is generally
curable; later, a cure admits of doubt.</p>

<p>Princess Esterhazy, who was so long in England, consulted
all the leading medical men in Vienna for a cancer in the
breast: they could afford her no relief. She went to Gräfenberg
and was perfectly cured in seven months. Six years afterwards,
one of the family informed me she still continued in perfect
health.</p>

<p>A neighbour of Priessnitz had a cancer in his hip; he
advised him not to allow of an operation, as it would grow
again. The man disregarded this advice, it did grow again,
and his life paid the forfeit. A general treatment is required
for this complaint.</p>

<p>Our opinion that water, even without Priessnitz&rsquo;s valuable
modes of applying it, is the best remedy&mdash;is supported by Dr.
Abernethy, who, in his book entitled &ldquo;Surgical Observations&rdquo;,
mentions a case of a lady (page 200), who had gone up to town
for the removal of a diseased breast, who was cured without
amputation, the only local application being linen moistened
with water. Dr. Abernethy applied water poultices also for
glandular swellings, which had the effect of removing the
swelling without suppuration&mdash;<i>see pages</i> 189 and 192. I know
a French lady who cured herself of a hard swelling on the
breast: she took a rubbing-sheet every morning, a sitz-bath at
mid-day, drank ten tumblers of water daily, and wore a wet
bandage, with a dry one over it, on the breast always, until
the hardness was removed.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>A case of White Swelling.</i>&mdash;A letter from Dr. Gibbs to the
Editor of the Water-cure Journal.</p>

<p>
<span class="ml2em">&ldquo;My dear Sir,</span> <span class="inrtabs">&ldquo;<i>March, 17th, 1848</i>.</span>
</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have heard even friends of the Water-cure express<span class="pagenum" title="188"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188"></a></span>
doubts of its efficacy in the treatment of white swelling. For
the benefit of such unbelievers I transcribe the case at foot,
from a letter which I received from the mother of the youthful
patient.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The enemies of the system frequently assert that it cures
only imaginary diseases; how many would rejoice if it could
be proved that white swelling properly came under this
category!</p>

<p>&ldquo;From the details of this case, it appears that, by the advice
of Priessnitz, an operation was performed by the late very
eminent surgeon, Dieffenbach; and this affords occasion to
observe, that Dieffenbach several times remarked, that patients
sent to him from Water-cure establishments were in a healthier
condition for the knife than others, and more speedily recovered
from the effects of an operation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Until the age of four years my daughter was perfectly
healthy, when, at the commencement of winter, she was
attacked by cough and wheezing on her chest, which gave
the idea that her lungs were affected. Leeches were applied,
and medicine given with little effect. She continued to look
very ill, and became extremely peevish and inactive. In the
spring she was suddenly seized by a pain in her left knee,
which rendered her quite lame. The complaint was pronounced
to be white swelling. One of our first surgeons
assured me the attack was of a most acute nature, the joint of
the knee being considerably enlarged, and the suffering very
great. By steam-baths and leeching the inflammation was in
some degree subdued, and mercury was used in various ways,
internally, and externally. In a week or ten days the violent
pain subsided, but she could not bear the limb to be moved
in the slightest manner. In that state the child continued
for eighteen months, during which she had three acute attacks
similar to the first, which were got under in the same manner,
after each attack the limb became more contracted, and the constitution
was evidently sinking, although wine, porter, and fresh
meat, etc. etc., were allowed, in order to keep up her strength,
but they did not succeed. She was at the sea-side for the
benefit of the bathing, which appeared to strengthen her more
than anything else, when I learned something of the water
system from Captain Claridge&rsquo;s book, and subsequently from
himself. At first, I must confess, I was rather startled at<span class="pagenum" title="189"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189"></a></span>
the idea of trying such an experiment on my child, but, as
every thing else had failed, I made up my mind to go to
Gräfenberg and put her into the hands of Mr. Priessnitz. In
the beginning of September he commenced with her, giving
her at first two packings up and a tepid bath, and one knee-bath
during the day, and compresses on the knee and body.
He desired that she should have crutches, and try to move
about as much as she could without hurting herself. She
continued the same treatment during the ensuing winter,
during which she had a constant rash on her entire leg, and
subsequently several gatherings on and round the knee, none
on any other part of her body. In the spring she commenced
the cold bath after the packing up, and the douche bath.
Her strength increased rapidly, her looks became quite healthy,
and her appetite excellent. The appearance of the knee was
very variable until the end of the summer, when it diminished
considerably in size, and she could bear to have it moved
without any annoyance; but about Christmas it became suddenly
nearly as bad as ever it had been. All cure was then
stopped, except one packing up and tepid bath, and the knee
compresses were changed every quarter of an hour. The inflammation
and pain were soon got under, but she continued
the slight cure until the spring, when she commenced the
packing up and cold bathing twice a day&mdash;douche-bath twice,
and knee-bath twice, with rubbing with the wet hand, and compresses
changed after every operation. During this summer she
made a wonderful improvement, and the limb became so strong
that she could bear to have it pulled so as to drag her about
by it. Mr. Priessnitz said he thought the child was now
quite free from <i>all disease</i>, and that I might have an operation
performed to straighten the limb, in which opinion several
English medical men quite agreed with him. I then took her
to Berlin, having been two years at Gräfenberg; the leg was
made quite straight by Dr. Dieffenbach, and since then the
child enjoys perfect health, being quite strong on her limbs,
though still somewhat lame. She continues the use of the
cold bath and douche every day. It is generally thought
that she will outgrow the lameness. I forgot to mention that
from the time the knee was attacked, the chest and cough
quite recovered.&rsquo;&rdquo;<span class="pagenum" title="190"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190"></a></span></p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Swallowing Glass.</i>&mdash;A cure effected in the house of the
Princess Sophia, by her priest, the Rev. Mr. Klose:&mdash;</p>

<p class="inrt">
<i>June 1st, 1843.</i>
</p>

<p>A married woman, 26 years of age, in eating, swallowed a
piece of glass, which stuck in her throat; after many unavailing
efforts, either to force it up or down, she sent for a surgeon,
who gave her an emetic, which also proved unavailing; then
he tried to extract it with instruments, and applied a number
of leeches to the throat, <i>to no effect</i>. The second day, the
surgeon declared he could do no more, and she was attacked
with inflammatory fever. As a <i>dernier ressort</i>, Mr. Klose
determined on trying hydropathy.</p>

<p>She was enveloped and kept in the wet sheet, with bandages
round the throat, day and night, both being changed as soon
as they became warm.</p>

<p>At the beginning of this treatment, the invalid was unable
to swallow even a drop of water, could scarcely breathe, and a
horrid smell came from the mouth. Her medical attendant
said that mortification had set in, and gave it as his opinion,
that she could not live through the next day.</p>

<p>Third and fourth days, the same treatment was continued,
with the addition of three enemas, which operated slightly.
The packing-sheet, instead of being changed, was wetted with a
sponge: moving the body occasioned pain. She threw up a
great deal of phlegm and matter, which stank so horribly, that
no person could remain near her bed-side.</p>

<p>Fifth day.&mdash;Vomiting increased, also the heat of the whole
body; the increase of heat rendered it necessary (notwithstanding
the pain she felt on being moved) to administer a
tepid-bath 18°. Whilst in the bath, her head, throat, and chest,
were frequently wetted with cold water, and the abdomen and
feet were well rubbed. This bath afforded her great relief,
and whilst in it, she threw up much matter with ease and
without coughing. She remained in the bath thirty-five
minutes, the same temperature of the water being maintained
throughout. At the expiration of this time, the body was
considerably cooled, but the pulse was still very high; for
which reason, recourse was again had to the packing-sheet,
which produced a regularity of the pulse. She was now
enabled to swallow the first drop of water.</p>

<p>Sixth day.&mdash;Mortification pronounced to be subdued, but as<span class="pagenum" title="191"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191"></a></span>
she could not take anything in the way of nourishment, four
injections of milk were administered, and when fever returned,
water injections instead of milk were given.</p>

<p>Seventh day.&mdash;Besides the former treatment, a tepid-bath
was administered, with the same effect as on the fifth day, viz.
much vomiting and decrease of cough.</p>

<p>Eighth day.&mdash;Patient much better, treatment in consequence
changed, only large bandages being applied to the chest, throat,
and neck, and in the afternoon she could swallow some cold
thin soup.</p>

<p>Ninth day.&mdash;Heat and fever returned, large quantities of
matter vomited, and inflammation of windpipe. Treatment
changed back again to packing-sheet and bandage and one
tepid-bath.</p>

<p>Tenth, Eleventh, and Twelfth days, same treatment.</p>

<p>Thirteenth day.&mdash;Fever ceased, vomiting diminished, and
patient able to swallow some milk and water.</p>

<p>Fourteenth and Fifteenth days.&mdash;Great improvement, could
eat a little apple sauce.</p>

<p>Sixteenth day.&mdash;Some fever, but she could swallow some
spoonfuls of milk without coughing.</p>

<p>Seventeenth day.&mdash;After a tolerably quiet night, there was
found in the bed a piece of glass, which must have been thrown
up by coughing.</p>

<p>Eighteenth, Nineteenth, Twentieth, and Twenty-first days.&mdash;Great
improvement, and diminution of vomiting, also of
bad smell. She drank, and ate some light food very slowly,
but without coughing.</p>

<p>Twenty-second day to 8th July.&mdash;Every day improvement,
recovering strength, and walking a little in the garden.</p>

<p>9th July.&mdash;Went to church.</p>

<p>10th.&mdash;Resumed her occupations, quite well, except when
working she suffered some slight pain, which ceased when she
rested.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Mr. Wright&rsquo;s case.</i>&mdash;(Extract from a letter)&mdash;&ldquo;Diseased
lungs, breathing organs generally impaired, chest, formerly full
and prominent, fallen in, breathing difficult, sleep disturbed,
dry cough, sometimes painful, for more than a year; a short
walk caused perspiration, 46 years old, formerly robust, healthy,
and strong.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="192"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192"></a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Cold water my only beverage for fifteen years, no alcohols.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Three years ago began flannels, fur muffles round neck.
Used every possible precaution to keep the fresh air from throat,
chest, body, and lungs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Habituated to cold ablutions, it never occurred to me, that
if the body could stand these ablutions, no ill consequences
could result from admitting the air freely to it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Began hydropathic treatment at Gräfenberg, 10th January,
1843, thermometer at zero. At once abandoned all flannels, and
superfluous covering. Linen shirts substituted for cotton ones.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Treatment:&mdash;two packing-sheets, followed by tepid-bath,
a day; at eleven o&rsquo;clock sitz-bath. Waist bandages always. Drank
ten tumblers of water before breakfast. Hail, rain, or snow, always
walked before breakfast; soon commenced the douche and
two rubbing-sheets of an afternoon, instead of the packing-sheets.</p>

<p>&ldquo;From the first, found the treatment, the exercise and pure
air, exceedingly stimulating.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Neck, throat, and chest, exposed in all weathers. In three
months a rash was produced; appetite voracious, breathing
improved, cough ceased.</p>

<p>&ldquo;About 1st April, joints, especially knees, began to grow
stiff, sore, and weak&mdash;pain in walking, and difficulty of
straightening knees after sitting. Low and gloomy in spirits,
and altogether disheartened; told by people around it was a
good sign; the treatment was taking effect, and so indeed I
found it, affecting body and soul.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whole body became very sensitive to the touch of cold
water; it seemed as if the nerves were laid bare; in fact, had
a perfect horror of the treatment, which became more intolerable
as the season advanced and became damp. Damp weather
of April worse than the cold of January and February. Now
became afflicted with throbbing pains in teeth, jaws, and face,
attended with sickness, for which I rubbed the back of my
head, neck, and face with cold water, and also my knees frequently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; says Mr. Wright, &ldquo;was the crisis of my misery. The
most enthusiastic hydropathist could not have wished me more
wretched than I was. It appears to me, the only way to a
cold water heaven, is through a cold water purgatory. I was
frequently congratulated on my sufferings, as one making a
speedy and radical cure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="193"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193"></a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Latter end of April, boils made their appearance on arms,
hands, fingers, and other parts of the body. All came to a
head, and healed during the month of May, and more succeeded
them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Continued treatment vigorously, exposing myself to atmospheric
changes as much as possible. I now feel, that <i>all disease
of my lungs is removed</i>. <i>My chest has resumed its natural
fulness, my cough is entirely</i> gone, and my voice is as strong
and as deep-toned as it ever was. Altogether my physical
nature has experienced a great renovation. I can now walk
six or eight miles before breakfast without fatigue. I have
walked, on an average, about ten miles a-day since at Gräfenberg.
What of life, of usefulness, of health and comfort that
remains to me in this world, I owe to the Water-cure under
Providence, and to the kind friends who, much against my
will, compelled me to come to Gräfenberg. Nothing surprised
me so much, as the perfect safety with which I cast off my
warm comfortable flannels, mufflers, neckcloth, hat, etc. Inflamed
lungs, and an increase of my cough, were the least that
I expected; but I was most agreeably disappointed, for although
frequently wet through, and my neck, chest, and the hair of
my head (as I always went bare-headed) constantly covered
with snow, my lungs have always escaped, nor have I had a
cold, that a packing-sheet, or one night&rsquo;s bandage has not
removed. I frequently, on arriving at my room drenched
with rain, wet, and fatigued, took a rubbing-sheet, which prevented
all evil consequences, and invigorated me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;From what I have experienced and seen in others, I can
never again fear cold, influenza, or fevers of any kind, as I feel
sufficient confidence to treat myself. The most malignant
acute diseases are here speedily and easily subdued, and that
by a remedy which leaves no sting behind, whilst drugs often
leave an enemy in the system more difficult to expel, than <i>that</i>
they were intended to eject.</p>


<p>&ldquo;It is surprising what confidence all exhibit in the cure and
its practitioners. We have just had a case of small-pox, of the
most malignant kind. Persons passed through the passage
into which the patient&rsquo;s room opened all day long. The same
bath-servant that attended him attended other patients. The
latter went into his room constantly to see him. His wife
attended him, and yet no one thought of taking the disease;<span class="pagenum" title="194"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194"></a></span>
or if he did, had any fear of it, knowing from what we had
previously witnessed, that it was entirely under the control of
this treatment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The patient was confined to his room fourteen days, the
disease broke out from head to foot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After the fourteen days, he walked out amongst the other
patients, and the wonder is, that nearly every trace of disease
is passing from his face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Treatment.&mdash;Packing-sheets, tepid-bath, rubbing-sheets
and fresh air were the only remedies.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="mt15em inrt">
&ldquo;<i>June 20th.</i><br />
</p>

<p>&ldquo;Before closing, I wish to add, I suffered much from tooth-ache
and pain in my jaws. Priessnitz ordered me to rub the
back of my head and down my neck <i>often</i> and <i>long</i>. From the
first application I found relief, after fourteen or fifteen minutes
rubbing. The pain would leave for hours and then return;
soon the pain returned at longer intervals, until it ceased
altogether.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The theory of this mode of curing tooth-ache, is based upon
true philosophical principles. Who does not know, that all the
nerves of the teeth centre in the back of the head? It is
evident then, that by rubbing there, the pain will be drawn
from the teeth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have now been three months out of the treatment, only
continuing the bath and rubbing-sheet; neither of which shall
I ever abandon, as I consider them luxuries, and preventives
of disease. I would rather be deprived of one of my daily
meals, than of either of them. I am now well, and about to
return to the field of my labours.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whoever is ill and not passed recovery, may, I believe, find
health by the treatment administered by Priessnitz, provided
he is willing to labour for it, but if any one expects to find it
whilst wrapped up in flannels, lounging in easy chairs or on
sofas, in confined rooms, or without great self-denial, personal
activity and exertion, he will, most certainly, be disappointed.</p>

<p class="mt15em"><i>The Countess of Jennison&rsquo;s case.</i>&mdash;The Countess, who had
only been married seven weeks, went to visit the Princess
Tour and Taseis, when she joined in skating, dancing, and
playing at various games. On her return home, she was seized
with a violent head-ache, when a blister was administered to
the back of her neck. The pain continuing, a blister was
applied to the chest, and subsequently to other parts, all
without avail. Several doctors were consulted, whose measures
weakened her nerves. A severe nervous fever ensued,
which deprived her entirely of the use of her limbs. After
seven months&rsquo; extreme suffering, and the speculative operations
of various medical men, the case was declared a hopeless
one.</p>

<p>She made her will, received the sacrament, and was at times
quite unconscious of what was passing around. Her debility
may be judged of by the fact that she could neither move joint
nor limb, nor even close her mouth or eyes. She was mere
skin and bones, and her knuckles became black.</p>

<p>Her husband, as a <i>dernier ressort</i>, went to Gräfenberg to
consult Priessnitz, the result of which was, Mrs. Browne, a
bath-woman, going to Brünn to bring the Countess to Gräfenberg,
Priessnitz persisting in it, that by management she
could be brought. When Mrs. Browne stated her intention
to the M.D.&rsquo;s in attendance, nothing could exceed their astonishment.
The first thing this bath-woman did, preparatory to
the journey, was to wash the body with tepid water, and it is
heart-rending to hear her account of the manner in which tow
had been allowed to fix itself in the hips, elbows, and other
parts exposed to pressure; however, little by little she succeeded
in cleansing the body of all these medical applications.
She then ordered an upholsterer to make a soft, narrow, mattress,
with a number of tapes attached to it, and the Count
arranged the carriage so that the body might be extended in it.</p>

<p>The next morning, all being ready, Mrs. Browne bound up
the arms, the legs, and the whole of the body, in a number of
wet bandages, with dry ones over them, by this means there
was more pliancy to the whole frame than if it had been confined
in one sheet, and it was much easier to exchange the
different bandages when they became dry <i>en route</i>.</p>

<p>The Countess was now fixed on the mattrass by means of
the tapes, and then placed into the carriage: in this manner<span class="pagenum" title="196"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196"></a></span>
she proceeded, night and day, stopping occasionally to change
the bandages. Had these bandages become dry, they would
not have been endurable. In this way the patient arrived at
the Hygeian Temple.</p>

<p>It would be impossible to give a detailed account of the
Countess&rsquo;s treatment during the time she was attaining to
convalescence. As a general outline, it may be stated, that
when first brought to Gräfenberg, she was constantly kept in
a packing-sheet from the arm-pits downwards. Her feet were
kept in water, with but slight intervals, day and night for
months; even when somewhat better, and able to go out in a
carriage, her feet were in cold water. Priessnitz did not wish
this, but her feet burned so dreadfully when out of water, that
there was no alternative. During the first four months of the
treatment, enemas were administered, nature being too weak
to assist itself. When she had gained a little strength, her
hands were put on the table and pushed on a few inches by
her attendant, and the same with her feet. She could not move
them herself. After four months she was strong enough for
the douche and cold-bath.</p>

<p>The packing-sheets were changed when dry&mdash;at times in
fever they were hot in ten minutes, at other times two packing-sheets
a day were sufficient.</p>

<p>At the end of forty-nine weeks she left strong and healthy,
able to walk without sticks, and was three months advanced in
pregnancy.</p>

<p class="inrt">1845.</p>

<p>Four years after I met the Countess again, at Gräfenberg,
and was astonished to behold her such a fine, fat, healthy
woman. Since being cured she has had three children, one
died almost immediately after its birth, the second is a fine
child, and for her accouchement of the third, she came to
place herself under the care of Priessnitz. She did remarkably
well, and left Gräfenberg in perfect health.</p>

<p>I consider this one of the most wonderful cures effected by
Priessnitz. Those who saw the complete <i>anatomie vivante</i>,
which she was, declared that nothing but a miracle could save
her from her early tomb.</p>

<h2>HYDROPATHY FOR ANIMALS.</h2>


<p>The unspeakable utility of the horse to man in all conditions
of life, civilised and uncivilised, has naturally led scientific
and professional individuals to devote much anxious consideration
to the physiology of the animal, and to the determination
of the means of healing the diseases which horse-flesh &ldquo;is heir
to.&rdquo; Buffon placed the horse next to man in the order of
creation; and certainly if the anatomical structure of the equine
species be alone regarded, an argument is provided in favor of
the consecration of thought and intelligence to the establishment
of curative remedies for its disorders. But the service
which the noble animal has rendered in all ages and countries
where the breed is known&mdash;his docility, instinct, patience, and
courage, have entitled him to the advantages of human intelligence
upon the high ground of gratitude; and, accordingly,
for many years past, the veterinary art has been pursued with
remarkable zeal and earnestness; the loftiest minds not conceiving
the study and practice thereof below their attention.
If, however, the attainment of perfection in the faculty of
curing the bodily ailments of man is a work of tardy progress,
how much slower must be the advancement of a science of
posterior introduction? It was but in the last century that the
circulation of the blood was discovered, and vaccination introduced;
it is only within the last six or seven years that the
vast utility of hydropathy has come to be appreciated. There
is now, however, less excuse for dilatory improvement in
veterinary practice than there was when the alleviation of
human suffering was in its infancy. The physiology and
pathology of the quadruped being understood, the value of the
immediate adoption of the remedies applicable to man is at
once determinable by anatomical analogy. Hence the introduction
of new systems of treatment has been almost simultaneous,
and in very many instances the results have been<span class="pagenum" title="198"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198"></a></span>
correspondingly fortunate. Hydropathy is a very remarkable
case in point, and the following pages will illustrate its value.</p>

<p>Priessnitz&rsquo;s precepts recommend themselves as much to the
veterinary surgeon as to the medical practitioner; the success
of his treatment of the diseased animal being, perhaps, even
more easy and certain than of man.</p>

<p>To understand this it will suffice to compare the habits and
mode of living of each. A further investigation will account
for the general health of untamed animals, and the host of
maladies that result from civilisation. On one side all is nature,
on the other all is artificial.</p>

<p>As the treatment of the horse or cow at Gräfenberg is not
of very frequent occurrence, Priessnitz has not laid down any
positive rules for the manipulation; that must therefore depend
upon the ingenuity, observation, and experience, of the practitioner.</p>

<p>If, for instance, a horse or cow is attacked with fever,
cholic, etc., reference should be made to the treatment of man
affected with such complaints. All that has been said on the
subject of drugs, the lancet, cold ablutions, and the importance
of the skin applies equally to all animals.</p>

<p>How can we expect to cure horses with poisons?</p>

<p>How get them into condition, by depriving them of their
blood?</p>

<p>A gentleman of high standing in society, and well known
in the sporting world, having, some years since, derived great
advantage from the Water-cure, determined on trying its effects
upon animals, by becoming his own veterinary surgeon; the
consequence is, that for five or six years he has not spent one
shilling upon drugs of any kind. On being applied to for his
opinion as to the effect of the treatment upon horses, he favored
the author with a letter of which the following is an extract:</p>


<p class="mt15em">&ldquo;With respect to the treatment of horses, my groom can
give no information, excepting indeed, that he can verify the
good effect of the treatment insisted upon by myself; and such
is his prejudice (exactly similar to that of the Medical Profession)
that he would, I am sure, revert to his former practices
if he dared. But I can most safely affirm that the effect of
the Hydro-therapeutic Treatment of Horses, is most wonderful.
I have, with coach horses and hacks, say forty horses. I<span class="pagenum" title="199"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199"></a></span>
never allow of any bleeding or physic. When the hunters
are to be prepared for the season, two or three of a day
are whisped over with cold water, a linen cloth of fifteen
or sixteen yards in length, dipped in cold water and well
wrung out, is then lapped round from their heads to their
tails, covered over with rugs, and bound pretty close by
surcingles: thus they remain for an hour or so, when they are
again rubbed over with cold water, followed by rubbing
with dry cloth or whisps quite dry, and then sent out to
exercise for twenty-five minutes, or half an hour. This treatment
is continued twice or thrice a week, for <i>at least</i> half a
dozen times; and I&rsquo;ll venture to say that nobody&rsquo;s horses can
look, or go better; and they never ail. I will just relate one fact.
I bought a horse for Mrs. &mdash;&mdash; seven or eight years ago,
a most excellent lady&rsquo;s horse, but he coughed so badly (always)
three or four years since, that we thought she would be obliged
to give him up, he has been treated as above for two years;
I rode him a gallop a few days ago, when he had not a
symptom of cough. Many dealers have been through my
stable:&mdash;Smart, Elmore, etc. etc., and they have all adopted my
plan of bandaging the legs of their horses, which I do for two
days after a day&rsquo;s work; and as Elmore said last spring, they
looked &lsquo;as if they were going to begin a season instead of
ending one,&rsquo; so clear were their legs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If a new horse (which is often the case) comes down by
railroad, he generally gets a sore throat and cold, this, I need
not tell you, is soon got rid of, as above.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>May 4, 1848.</i></p>

<p class="mt15em">The following extract is from a letter to the author&mdash;written
by a gentleman whose health has been re-established
by the Water-cure; who, during the last forty years, has been
the possessor of hundreds of horses, and is said to be one of
the best judges of a horse in England.</p>

<p class="mt15em">&ldquo;I will not defer answering your interesting letter, although
I know not that I can write anything to be of much use to
you. The manner in which I have treated my horses for the
last thirty years is as follows:&mdash;If it is in my power I
always bring a horse in cool, my groom first puts a common
watering bridle on, takes one girth off, and slackens the other,
the reason why I do not remove the saddle immediately is,<span class="pagenum" title="200"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200"></a></span>
because the back becomes tender; the horse is then taken into
the pond, the boy holding up his own legs, the higher the
water gets towards the back the better; that is, let the animal
go as deep into water as he can, not to swim; this takes two
or three minutes, then two men take scrapers, and with these
press out the dripping water, after this, with straw whisps, the
animal is washed for about ten minutes, he is then covered up
with two blankets, and his legs bandaged; the ears are now
well rubbed and pulled until dry: this is all I do to a horse.
He does not break out into cold perspirations during the night,
and next morning he is perfectly clean. By putting your
hands under the blankets when he is done up for the night,
you will find a genial warmth pervading the whole body.
Blood horses, however fatigued, are usually very sensitive to
the brush and whisp, consequently cleaning tires them still
more, which causes them almost always to break out into cold
sweats. The ventilation which ought to be at the top of the
stable, must be good, otherwise the system works ill. Owing
to the unusual good health that I have had in my stable, I
was led to think most seriously of applying water in a similar
way to the human subject, so that after reading your book, I
became at once a confirmed Hydropathist. Many people will
say, my system was that pursued in the post-horse stables;
but the contrary is the fact. The post horse was washed, and
his heels clipped close, and left to dry without friction, evaporation
was great, grease and other maladies attacked the animal.
I know a coach master who saved £400 per annum by giving
up washing upon this old plan. You have now got the result
of my experience. I have had fewer roarers than most men
for the number of horses in my possession, in fact, only two,
one of these went so, when lent and out of my stable. The
loss in valuable horses from roaring is enormous. I think a
friend of mine lost £700 in one season from roarers, I have
the confidence to think that had he pursued the Water-system
all his horses would have been saved. Be assured, water is
as applicable to the animal as the human subject&mdash;fever is
the bane of the one as much as the other, and water is the
antidote. Why are cart-horses so much healthier than higher
fed horses? simply because the former live much more after
nature than the other. A cart-horse goes to a pond and drinks
what he likes, not so with the blood horse, he must only have<span class="pagenum" title="201"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201"></a></span>
a certain quantity, and this at stated periods; this I conceive
to be wrong, and have in consequence for the last six years
always kept buckets of water in the horses&rsquo; boxes, so that
they might drink when they liked. My friends have often
said, &lsquo;But you do not allow them thus to drink when going
to hunt?&rsquo; &lsquo;Certainly&rsquo; was my reply: if the animal always has
access to water, he never distends his stomach, and by constantly
sipping, fever is kept down. We do all we can to
encourage fever, and then have recourse to strong drastics
and bleeding! Constant water cools the animal, and the
gentle sweats, which the blankets produce, operate as safety
valves.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>January 5, 1848.</i></p>


<p class="mt15em">When in Ireland, visiting the far-famed dairy farm of Mr.
Jefferies, in the neighbourhood of Cork, I was informed by
the bailiff, that out of every seven cows attacked with an epidemic
which raged at that time, on an average five had died,
and that the loss on that estate had not been less than 2000<i>l</i>.
On my suggesting hydropathic treatment, the bailiff said that
some time ago a traveller by that means had cured him of
rheumatism; this determined him on trying it upon the cows:
success crowned his efforts; instead of losing five out of seven,
he saved seven out of nine; this treatment, however, at once
so novel and so troublesome, he found extremely difficult to
prosecute, servants could not be induced to use the necessary
friction, or endure the toil which a number of sick animals
entail: this, together with the discouragement and ridicule
thrown upon his proceedings by the veterinary surgeon, caused
him to desist. The following is a letter which I subsequently
read from the bailiff&mdash;</p>


<p class="mt15em">&ldquo;Dear Sir&mdash;I am most anxious to communicate with you as
to the efficacy of the cold-water cure, when applied to cattle
affected with the late epidemic.</p>

<p>&ldquo;About six months ago, I had it tried on nine head of
horned cattle; seven out of the nine recovered, and are now
doing well. I feel quite confident that, if the cure be <ins title="Transcriber's Note: originally &lsquo;genenerally&rsquo;">generally</ins>
known, and properly applied, much may be done in
the recovering of diseased cattle.</p>

<p class="inrt">
&ldquo;I am, Dear Sir, your obedient servant,&emsp;&emsp;<br />
<span class="smcap">[&ldquo;]Thomas B. Martin.</span></p>

<p class="ml2em">[&ldquo;]<i>July 14, 1843.</i>[&rdquo;]</p>

<p class="mt15em"><span class="pagenum" title="202"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202"></a></span></p>

<p>It is possible that the omission of any reference to the
mortality under the old treatment, as stated verbally to me,
may have arisen from motives of delicacy towards those who
recommended a perseverance in that treatment.</p>

<p>It would be easy to multiply instances of the effect of the
application of the cold-water cure, but as the limits to which
the author intends to confine himself, at present preclude their
accumulation, he must be content with those proofs of its
efficacy already cited, and proceed to the subject of <i>treatment</i>.</p>

<p>An opinion is held by many inexperienced persons that disease
in a horse is a perpetual disqualification; that the physical
evil is irradicable, destroying the animal&rsquo;s title to a future warranty,
and rendering him only fit for the paddock or the knacker&rsquo;s
yard. Such notions are as great an outrage upon the usefulness
of veterinarianism as they are contradictory to all experience.
The late Sir Astley Cooper, one of the most eminent surgeons
that ever dignified the profession by his talents, was said to
have taken a peculiar pleasure in purchasing horses which their
owners had condemned, and applying himself to the cure of
such maladies as they might be afflicted with, then putting
them into condition and selling them. He never, for many
years before his demise, gave more than seven pounds for a
horse, and has been known to sell them afterwards for considerable
sums. When the horse is well-bred, and his wind is
unimpaired, however reduced he may be, and suffering from
enlarged joints and tender feet, he is still susceptible of cure;
and no system is so conducive to this end as the hydropathic
process. Indeed, the writer of these pages is quite satisfied
that an Establishment devoted entirely to the invigoration of
worn-down animals, and the complete cure of the diseased,
would demonstrate the utility of hydropathy, and prove a most
lucrative undertaking.</p>

<p>Without further preamble we proceed to details.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Ventilation.</i>&mdash;The introduction of fresh air, day and night,
into stables, is of primary importance. Stables should be lofty,
and ventilated from the top.</p>

<p>Many years ago, Mr. Horne, the coach-proprietor of Charing
Cross, lost nearly half his horses from glanders. He called in
a new veterinary surgeon, who instantly broke most of the
windows in the close f&oelig;tid stable. &ldquo;If,&rdquo; said he, <span class="pagenum" title="203"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203"></a></span>&ldquo;the stable
is cold, cover the horses better, but let them have fresh air.&rdquo;
By this means the stable was rendered wholesome, and the
horses that were afterwards put into it continued healthy. All
horses would be the better for standing in water occasionally.
All hunting establishments should have a box with a clay
floor, into which water could be introduced, so that a horse
might have a foot bath every day, especially when the feet
are hard and dry.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Food and Exercise.</i>&mdash;The arguments made use of against
highly nutritive food, and the necessity for exposure to cold
and exercise for man apply with equal cogency to animals.</p>

<p>Mr. Newman, the postmaster in Regent-street, has no racks
in his stable; but his horses, at stated periods, eat chaff and
oats mixed together: he gives them no hay. This method
of feeding horses is found economical and healthy. A friend
of mine feeds all his farm horses as he does his oxen and pigs,
upon Indian corn, oil cake, chaff, and bruised beans boiled up
together. He never gives them any oats, and no horses in the
kingdom look in finer condition.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Sudorific Process.</i>&mdash;This is the same for horses as for men;
and is often sufficient to effect a cure, as the greatest part of
the diseases of horses proceed from suppressed perspiration.
In a general way packing-sheets and consequent ablutions will
effect all that may be necessary to cure a horse or a cow of an
acute attack, but instances as in man, may occur, when sweating
would be desirable.</p>

<p>To produce perspiration in a horse the same objection to the
use of hot-air or vapour baths, exists as in the treatment or
man; but as the animal&rsquo;s skin and nervous system is less excitable,
it does not apply to the same extent.</p>

<p>To sweat a horse, that is to bring out of his system a
certain amount of caloric. Throw many pails of water over
him, let his body be rubbed with wet whisps for from five
to twenty minutes, and then rubbed dry. Next envelope
him from head to foot in blankets, and over them throw a
Macintosh cover. This might be made to be put on with very
little trouble. After the horse has perspired, for an hour or
two he must have a cold bath or undergo the process of water
being thrown over him, of being wet, whisped, and dried as<span class="pagenum" title="204"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204"></a></span>
before. And the whole should be renewed a second time
during the day. Or varied by the packing sheet.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>External use of Cold Water.</i>&mdash;Friction with coarse wet cloths
or whisps, packing-sheets, sweating, entire-baths, hip-baths,
foot-baths, douche-baths, and bandages, constitute all the
external treatment requisite for a horse. Friction by rubbing
the body of the animal for some hours with coarse cloths,
and whisps of wetted straw, is an operation of great
efficacy in bringing out stagnant humours, reanimating half
paralysed limbs, and in strengthening the joints. The douche,
where no other can be had, is applied by means of a fire-engine.
The baths have the property of giving a tone to the skin and
the nerves. The bandages for the horse are the same as those
used for man; they are of two sorts, heating and cooling.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Internal use of Cold Water.</i>&mdash;There are two ways of applying
cold water internally, viz.: drinks and injections into the
cavities; but ablutions long continued and often repeated form
the most important part of the treatment.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>The Strangles.</i>&mdash;This disease is cured by the wet sheet
packing, or the sudorific process, cold-ablution bandages and
exercise.</p>

<p>It is much better, by either of these processes, to draw the
humours to the skin, which they undoubtedly will, than to
throw them on the lungs, whence they escape by the nostrils,
a means of evacuation chosen by nature. The natural course
being impeded, open the pores of the cutaneous organs, and
the running at the nostrils will cease.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Foundering of horses.</i>&mdash;Friction, the wet-sheet or sudorific
process, the douche and foot-baths, are here brought into
requisition.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>The Staggers.</i>&mdash;Bleeding procures a temporary relief, but
does not remove the cause of this complaint, which arises from
a stoppage of perspiration, and consequent inertness of the skin.
The humours which ought to be eliminated by perspiration
mix with and thicken the blood; this causes a general stagnation
which frequently affects the brain. This, it is conceived,<span class="pagenum" title="205"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205"></a></span>
must be a solution of this malady, because in the beginning
one single friction, powerfully applied, affords immediate relief.</p>

<p>In severe cases, the animal should be subjected to the
sweating process, and cold ablution. The animal&rsquo;s head should
be wetted every hour with cold water, and green food prescribed
as a diet. The douche in these cases is of the greatest
utility.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Weakness of the Limbs, and Sprains.</i>&mdash;These affections are
generally successfully treated by constant friction with cold
water. This rubbing subdues the heat; bandages should be
continually worn. The weakness of the hips and loins soon
disappears under this treatment; the douche in these cases is
highly beneficial.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Broken Knees.</i>&mdash;Let the part be carefully washed, then
bandages applied <i>above</i>, and <i>below</i>, and <i>upon</i> the part affected,
and kept continually wet as long as inflammation continues.
After which, use wet bandages, covered with dry ones, until the
part is healed.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>External Inflammation and Wounds.</i>&mdash;After having well
cleaned the sore, it should be covered with a heating-bandage;
and if the inflammation is severe, and the heat great, the bandage
should be frequently renewed. The animal should take
a bath, but without wetting the wound.</p>

<p>External inflammation proceeds from two causes; first, the
tightness of the saddle, which wounds the flesh; secondly,
from the blows which the horse receives. As soon as you perceive
that the horse has been hurt by the saddle, take it off,
and having rubbed him well dry, place upon the wound a heating-bandage,
firmly tied on, and let it be frequently renewed;
but always before renewing the bandage, clean the part affected
with cold water; the parts near the wound must be treated in
the same manner. This bandage and friction are useful in cases
of throat obstructions; the bandage must be changed as often as
it becomes hot. Before it becomes quite dry, it should be renewed,
taking care each time to rub well the parts affected,
which renders them, when exposed, less sensitive. This gives
elasticity to the wound.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="206"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206"></a></span></p>

<p class="mt15em"><i>Tender Feet.</i>&mdash;All horses should stand upon clay, bricks, or
stones; not upon straw, as it heats the feet too much. For
corns or tender feet, foot-baths for an hour or two, two or three
times a day are resorted to; and bandages should be worn from
the fetlock to the knee-joints, to draw the heat from the feet.
A friend of the author&rsquo;s, travelling on the Continent, tried this
on a mare which became lame: it succeeded admirably.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Cholic.</i>&mdash;Apply one or two clysters of cold water; wet the
body, and rub the animal well for an hour with wet whisps, and
then put round the body a sheet wetted and doubled several
times, covered with a dry blanket. If the first operation is not
sufficient, resort to the packing process, and afterwards the
rubbing. This system persevered in, the cholic is sure to give
way.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Lock-Jaw.</i>&mdash;Friction, the douche, and perspiration, are the
remedies resorted to. During the intervals of their application,
cold bandages should be applied.</p>

<p>The irritation of the skin counteracts the lock-jaw. The
efficiency of cold water in this complaint has been known in
England for years. An article, some time ago, appeared in the
Chelmsford paper, stating that the possessor of a valuable horse,
which had been seized with lock-jaw, after trying all other
means in vain, threw from the loft, upon the animal, a hogshead
or more of water, and then had him covered up in blankets.
This brought on perspiration, and a cure was the result.
An acquaintance of the author&rsquo;s, in Gloucester[s]hire, who treated
a horse in a similar way, was equally successful.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Fever and Inflammation.</i>&mdash;For the treatment of all fevers and
inflammations the reader is referred to the method prescribed
for human beings in similar cases.</p>

<p>For a horse in a high state of inflammation, Priessnitz prescribed
his being put into a river for five minutes, then taken
out, rubbed dry, for five minutes, then put again into the
water and again rubbed, a process renewed until the inflammation
had completely subsided. Sometimes this is effected in a
short time; at others, it requires constant application for seven
or eight hours. Perseverance in this treatment is certain of
effecting a cure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="207"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207"></a></span></p>

<p>In an ordinary case of fever, resort to the wet-sheet packing;
if necessary, change the sheet often, then administer a cold
bath or affusion; repeat the operation twice a-day.</p>

<p>In all cases of inflammation or fever, if the body is confined,
it is necessary to resort to clysters.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Want of appetite.</i>&mdash;If frictions with wisps of straw upon a
wet surface repeated three times a day do not produce appetite,
the wet-sheet packing followed by ablutions and bandages
must be resorted to.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>To refresh and invigorate a horse.</i>&mdash;Let him be well rubbed
with coarse wet cloths or whisps of hay for an hour or two
twice a day, then walked about until dry: a foot bath twice
a-day for an hour each time, and the loins and legs bandaged.</p>

<p>If the skin of the animal is dry and contracted, use the
packing sheet twice a day followed by cold-bath, or throw
several pails of water over the body, use friction until the skin
is dry, then bandage round the body.</p>

<p>If horses are allowed to be out at grass, they ought, nevertheless,
to undergo the operations. With certain exceptions
it would be better to keep horses up and send them out to
exercise at stated times.</p>

<p>After every operation animals ought to be led about a little.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Murrain amongst cattle.</i>&mdash;On the first symptom of the
disease, such as the coat starting, the animal is to be subjected
to the treatment until shivering is produced, and until shivering
has ceased, or at least greatly decreased.</p>

<p>This will require, generally, one, two, or three hours. The
animal should stand in a cold bath, that is, a pond or river,
and water must be continually thrown over the whole body.</p>

<p>During the whole operation, the body and legs of the animal
must be well rubbed with the hand, or with a coarse cloth or
whisp (that is, whilst in the bath).</p>

<p>It will require two men to do this properly. Should the
water be too deep for the men and sufficiently deep to cover
the back, the animal must remain five minutes in the water,
be then taken out and well rubbed for five minutes, and so
continued till the shivering described above is produced.</p>

<p>Should shivering <i>not</i> be produced the case is hopeless.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="208"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208"></a></span></p>

<p>On coming out of the bath, rub the animal for five minutes,
then give him half an hour&rsquo;s walking exercise, with a warm
rug as a covering.</p>

<p>The bath is to be repeated twice a-day. After exercise a
large piece of coarse cloth wetted with cold water is to be
placed over the body and chest, this wet linen is to be covered
with a dry one.</p>

<p>As soon as this bandage becomes dry, it must be re-wetted,
but before replacing it, rub the beast well for at least five
minutes.</p>

<p>This bandage is to be continued night and day and frequently
changed.</p>

<p>Administer two clysters a day, each to consist of a quart of
cold water.</p>

<p>Green food is best, but when this cannot be obtained, bran
wetted with cold water must be substituted.</p>

<p>The more water drunk the better.</p>

<p>This treatment is to be continued until the coat looks smooth
and healthy, and the appetite is regulated.</p>

<p>The first cold bath if carefully applied for two or three
hours, will check the disease.</p>


<p class="mt15em">Two cases of cure came under notice, whilst these pages
were in the press. One that of a bull of a spinal affection, and
a horse with a large swelling under the belly. The bull was
well rubbed all over with wet whisps, and afterwards had wet
bandages, dry ones were then applied. The horse was simply
bandaged, which bandages were changed when dry. He laid
down the second day, which he had not done for some days
before, and was well in three days.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Fits in Dogs.</i>&mdash;Immerse the body in cold water, and let it
be well rubbed until the dog recovers.</p>


<p class="mt15em">Cold water, tepid water and friction, packing sheets, the
sweating process, entire baths, hip baths, foot baths, the douche,
clysters and bandages, are all brought into requisition in the
treatment of beasts: therefore reference should be made to the
foregoing pages, in &ldquo;order to understand when any one or more
may be necessary.&rdquo; Experience proves that their effect upon
man or beast is the same.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="209"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209"></a></span></p>


<p>In order to give the practitioner an idea of how he might
treat a horse, I subjoin the mode of treatment I adopted upon
three horses belonging to a nobleman, whilst these pages were
going through the press.</p>

<p>Monday, 19th June, 1849.&mdash;Three horses ill, two with sore
throat and coughs, and one with pleurisy. Veterinary surgeon
on Sunday, bled and applied mustard poultices to the latter.
Monday morning, at ten o&rsquo;clock, horse no better, a doubtful
case. Proceeded as follows.</p>

<p>Took him out of the stable, drenched his whole body with
many pails of cold water, then had him rubbed for several
minutes with wet whisps&mdash;more water and whisps again, and
finally whisped dry. Then wet sheets, wrung out, were wound
round neck and body, and covered with dry ones. Before
twenty minutes elapsed he was in a glow&mdash;in this state he
remained for an hour and an half, when the water and friction
was again repeated. When nearly rubbed dry, a sheet
was doubled, wrung out in cold water, and placed round his
loins, a dry one over it, and rugs put to produce a re-action.
A change for the better was so evident, that the stud groom
(who at first was inimical to the process being tried), declared
his conviction it would cure the horse. The whole process was
repeated in the evening and next morning, when the horse&rsquo;s
appetite returned, and he was declared better. The same
evening he was subjected to the packing-sheet and ablution,
wore the bandage round the loins, and was cured. As the
medicine, administered the day before, had acted on the bowels,
I did not resort to clysters, which I otherwise should have
done.</p>

<p>For the sore throat, one horse the first day was treated
exactly as above described, but it was found unnecessary to
resort to the cold ablution, previous to the packing-sheet process.
A wet bandage covered with a dry one was worn round
his waist and throat continually.</p>

<p>The third horse, having a sore throat and slight cough, only
had a wet bandage with a dry one over it applied to the throat,
and changed when dry.</p>

<p>Thus, these three horses, without a grain of physic, were cured
in three or four days. The great advantages of being thus
cured, are, that the cold water created an appetite, whilst drugs
would have deprived the animals of it. It gave them strength,<span class="pagenum" title="210"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210"></a></span>
hardened the skin, and rendered them less susceptible to atmospheric
influence than they were before, and produced effects
the very opposite to those of drugs.</p>

<p>It must be obvious that this treatment had the effect of
equalising the circulation.</p>

<p>Several years ago I treated a horse in a similar way, twice a
day, for farcy, that is to say, I subjected him to the washing,
rubbing, wet-sheet, and bandages, as before described: in ten
days he was perfectly well. A friend of mine seeing a cow
belonging to a relation of his in the last stage, had her well
wetted and rubbed for an hour, put round her waist a wet
blanket, and covered her up warm; in a few hours she was
better. The treatment repeated a few times twice a day
effected a cure.</p>


<p class="mt15em"><i>Bandages.</i>&mdash;The application of wet bandages, covered with
dry ones round the loins, and to parts affected, after every application
of the Water-cure, is most important.</p>

<p>These bandages must be worn day and night; during the
day they should be changed whenever they become dry&mdash;it is
not necessary during the night, except where there is great
inflammation, the oftener they are changed the better.</p>

<p>Animals under treatment for fever, inflammations of any
kind, should be allowed to drink as much <i>cold water</i> as they
like, and eat green food.</p>

<p>To give a horse a hip-bath, which we call a sitz-bath, must
be left to the ingenuity of the practitioner; it is of equal advantage
in the treatment of horses as men, particularly in
attacks of cholic inflammation, etc.</p>


<p class="mt15em">The following extract from the <i>Weekly Dispatch</i>, of July
23, 1847, confirms what is advanced in favour of water; and
excites surprise that it did not lead scientific members of the
medical profession to more extensive inquiry:&mdash;</p>


<p class="mt15em">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Effect of Prussic Acid on a Rabbit.</span>&mdash;Yesterday
se&rsquo;nnight, Dr. Robinson, of London, delivered the third of a
series of dissertations on poisons, before the Faculty, at the
Maidstone Infirmary. The subject of the evening was principally
corrosive sublimate&mdash;on the mode of detecting which, the
learned lecturer imparted some valuable hints. At the conclusion<span class="pagenum" title="211"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211"></a></span>
of the dissertation, the effect of prussic acid was tried upon
a rabbit. Three drops were administered from a glass (the
surface of which, most probably, abstracted half of the quantity),
and the animal immediately exhibited the usual symptoms&mdash;increased
action of the lungs, dilatation of the pupils, and the
peculiar shrill cry, which in such cases is usually indicative of
immediately approaching dissolution. In order to give it a
chance of recovery, however, a few drops of ammonia were administered,
without apparent benefit. A constant stream of
cold water was then poured upon the base of the skull and along
the spine, when the animal very shortly exhibited symptoms
of resuscitation. It was then wrapped in warm flannel. In a
quarter of an hour, it was sufficiently recovered to walk. Dr.
Robinson had, in a former lecture, mentioned that this mode
of treatment had been discovered by accident. A cat which
had annoyed the apprentices of a chemist was poisoned by them
with prussic acid, and thrown away for dead. By mere accident,
however, it fell under a stream of water, which was
pouring from a pump; the effect of which was its gradual resuscitation.
Benefiting by this hint, the same means have
been since successfully applied to more than one human subject
who had taken prussic acid. No instance, however, had come
within Dr. Robinson&rsquo;s knowledge where an animal had been
restored after the symptoms which this rabbit exhibited; and
the singularity of the case struck the faculty as being one, a
knowledge of which it was desirable should be promulgated.
The rabbit is now in full health and vigour.[&rdquo;]</p>

<p class="inrt">&ldquo;Cork, Sept. 25th, 1845.</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My dear Mr. Priessnitz,&mdash;Though this is the first time I have had the honour
of writing to you, I look upon you as an old and much esteemed friend. This
feeling has encouraged me to address you as such, and to solicit a favour. You
have proved yourself the benefactor of the human family, and have much
promoted the sacred cause of total abstinence. As a trifling mark of the high
estimation in which I hold you, I presume to present the enclosed temperance
medal. Condescend to accept it, and to wear it, and you will confer a deep
obligation on, With profound respect, dear Mr. Priessnitz, Your devoted friend,

<p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_2"><span class="label">2</span></a> The following letter, extracted from Miss Costello&rsquo;s &ldquo;Summer among the
Bocages and Vines,&rdquo; chronicles another melancholy instance of persecution:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="inrt">&ldquo;Paris, Feb. 1641.</p>
<p>
&ldquo;My dear Effiat,</p>

<p>
&ldquo;While you are forgetting me at Narbonne, and giving yourself up to the
pleasures of the court, and the delight of thwarting M. le Cardinal de Richelieu,
I, according to your desire, am doing the honours of Paris to your English
lord, the Marquis of Worcester; and I carry him about, or rather he carries me,
from curiosity to curiosity, choosing always the most grave and serious, speaking
very little, listening with extreme attention, and fixing on those whom he
interrogates two large blue eyes, which seem to pierce to the very centre of their
thoughts. He is remarkable for never being satisfied with any explanations
which are given him, and he never sees things in the light in which they are
shown him, you may judge of this by a visit we made together to Bicêtre, where
he imagined he had discovered genius in a madman. If this madman had not
been actually raving, I verily believe your marquis would have entreated his
liberty, and have carried him off to London, in order to hear his extravagancies
from morning till night, at his ease. We were crossing the court of the mad-house,
and I, more dead than alive with fright, kept close to my companion&rsquo;s
side, when a frightful face appeared behind some immense bars, and a hoarse
voice exclaimed, &lsquo;I am not mad! I am not mad! I have made a discovery which
would enrich the country that adopted it!&rsquo; &lsquo;What has he discovered?&rsquo; I
asked of our guide. &lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; he answered, shrugging his shoulders, &lsquo;something
trifling enough; you would never guess it; it is the use of the steam of boiling
water.&rsquo; I began to laugh. &lsquo;This man,&rsquo; continued the keeper, &lsquo;is named
Solomon de Caus; he came from Normandy, four years ago, to present to the
king a statement of the wonderful effects that might be produced from the invention.
To listen to him, you would imagine that with steam you could
navigate ships, move carriages&mdash;in fact, there is no end to the miracles which,
he insists upon it, could be performed. The Cardinal sent the madman away
without listening to him. Solomon de Caus, far from being discouraged,
followed the Cardinal wherever he went with the most determined perseverance;
who, tired of finding him for ever in his path, and annoyed to death with his
folly, ordered him to be shut up in Bicêtre, where he has now been for three
years and half, and where, as you hear, he calls out to every visitor that he is
not mad, but that he has made a valuable discovery. He has even written a
book on the subject, which I have here.[&rsquo;] Lord Worcester, who had listened
to this account with much interest, after reflecting a time, asked for the book,
of which, after having read several pages, he said, &lsquo;This man is not mad. In
my country, instead of shutting him up, he would have been rewarded. Take
me to him, for I should like to ask him some questions.&rsquo; He was according
conducted to his cell, but after a time he came back sad and thoughtful. &lsquo;He
is indeed mad now,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;misfortune and captivity have alienated his reason,
but it is you who have to answer for his madness: for when you cast him into that
cell, you confined the greatest genius of the age.&rsquo; After this, we went away;
and since that time he has done nothing but talk of Solomon de Caus.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Adieu, my dear friend and faithful Henry.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Make haste and come back, and pray do not be so happy where you are as
not to keep a little love for me.
